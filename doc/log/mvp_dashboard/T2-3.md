# T2-3: Show arrange error feedback in UI

**Status:** Fix applied
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Problem
`_onError()` in `documentcontroller.py:927` only logged arrange failures to console. Users had no indication that auto-arrange failed.

## Fix
Added `QMessageBox.warning()` call after logging the error. The error message from the server (e.g., "Diagram too large to arrange", "Arrangement service returned invalid data") is shown directly to the user. `QMessageBox` was already imported.

## File Changed
- `familydiagram/pkdiagram/documentview/documentcontroller.py:927-934`
