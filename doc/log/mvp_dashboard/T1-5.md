# T1-5: Include current date in extraction prompt

**Status:** Already implemented
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Finding
The current date is already injected into the extraction prompt. Both `update()` and `import_text()` in `pdp.py` format `DATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` with `current_date=reference_date.isoformat()`, where `reference_date` defaults to `datetime.now().date()`.

The prompt template at `prompts.py:248` includes `Today's date is: {current_date}`.

No changes needed.
