# T3-1: Fix cluster graph text overlap

**Status:** Fix applied, needs manual verification (Flask server not running)
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Problem
Narrow cluster bars (< 30px `minBarWidth`) placed a label above the bar with `width: 240` and `horizontalAlignment: Text.AlignHCenter`. This 240px label extended far beyond the bar boundaries, overlapping with labels from adjacent clusters in the same row.

## Fix
- Changed label from `width: 240` / center-aligned to `width: Math.max(barWidth, 80)` / left-aligned
- This constrains the label to at most 80px (or bar width if wider), preventing overlap with neighboring clusters

## File Changed
- `familydiagram/pkdiagram/resources/qml/Personal/LearnView.qml:1134-1147`
