# T2-6: Fix _log not defined when re-opening after deleting views

**Status:** Cannot reproduce — likely fixed by T0-1 or never existed as described
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Investigation
The analysis doc has only 2 lines: "Trigger: Re-opening diagram after deleting views with people. Related to layer reference cleanup."

Searched all scene files for logger naming inconsistencies (`_log` vs `log`). Found no file that uses `_log` without defining it:
- Files using `_log`: event.py, person.py, pathitem.py, commands.py — all define it
- Files using `log`: scene.py, emotions.py, marriage.py — all define it
- `layeritem.py`: uses neither `_log` nor `log`

The T0-1 fix (adding `elif self._layer:` guard in emotionalunit.py) may have fixed this — both crashes involve layer reference issues during item operations.

## Conclusion
No actionable code change identified. The bug may have been:
1. Already fixed by T0-1 (same layer-None crash)
2. A one-time occurrence without a saved traceback
3. A different variable name than `_log` (vague description)

Recommend marking as "needs reproduction" — if it recurs, capture the full traceback.
