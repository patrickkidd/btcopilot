# T1-3: Require Event.description in validation (reject null)

**Status:** Fix applied, tests pass
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Problem
`validate_pdp_deltas()` in `pdp.py:187-191` only warned on null `Event.description` but didn't reject it. Events without descriptions show empty text in the Learn view.

## Fix
Changed `_log.warning(...)` to `errors.append(...)` so events without descriptions are rejected during validation. The LLM extraction retry loop will catch this and re-extract with valid data.

## Files Changed
- `btcopilot/btcopilot/pdp.py:187-191` — warning to error
- `btcopilot/btcopilot/tests/schema/test_validation.py` — added `description` to all test Events going through validation, added `test_validate_deltas_rejects_event_without_description`

## Verification
- All 36 validation tests pass
