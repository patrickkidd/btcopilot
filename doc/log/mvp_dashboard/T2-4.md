# T2-4: Fix _do_addItem missing relationshipTriangle symbols

**Status:** Fix applied, tests pass
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Problem
`Scene._do_addItem()` only created Emotion symbols for `relationshipTriangles` when the event relationship was Inside or Outside. For all other relationship types (Fusion, Conflict, Distance, etc.), triangles were stored but no corresponding Emotion symbols were created, so they wouldn't appear on the diagram.

## Fix
Added `elif item.relationshipTriangles():` branch after the Inside/Outside-specific block (scene.py:500-512). For non-Inside/Outside relationship types, creates one Emotion per triangle with `kind=item.relationship()` — mirroring the same relationship kind used for targets.

Note: This only affects the file-load path (`_do_addItem` with `firstTimeAdding=True`). The interactive path (setting targets/triangles after adding the event) doesn't create emotions via `_do_addItem` — that's a separate concern for all relationship types, not just triangles.

## File Changed
- `familydiagram/pkdiagram/scene/scene.py:462-512` — added `elif` branch for non-Inside/Outside triangle emotions

## Test Added
- `test_non_inside_outside_triangle_creates_emotions` (parametrized: Fusion, Conflict, Distance) in `test_event_triangles.py`

## Verification
- All 100 related tests pass (triangle, emotion, scene add/remove, PDP-to-scene)
- 3 new parametrized test cases all pass
