# T3-3: Fix cluster graph layout spacing / empty space to right

**Status:** Fix applied, needs manual verification (Flask server not running)
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Problem
`applyOptimalZoom()` hardcoded `timelineZoom = 2.0` regardless of data. This caused the timeline to be 2x wider than the viewport, with `timelineScrollX = 0` showing only the left half. If clusters were concentrated in a narrow date range, the right portion of the view appeared empty.

## Fix
Changed `applyOptimalZoom()` to call `calculateOptimalZoom()` instead of hardcoding 2.0. The `calculateOptimalZoom()` function already exists and computes the ideal zoom so the narrowest cluster is at least `minBarWidth` (30px) wide.

## File Changed
- `familydiagram/pkdiagram/resources/qml/Personal/LearnView.qml:231-235` — `applyOptimalZoom()` now uses `calculateOptimalZoom()`
