# T3-2: Add selection highlight to cluster graph events

**Status:** Already implemented
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Finding
Multiple selection feedback mechanisms already exist in LearnView.qml:

1. **Mini-graph dots**: Selected event dot scales 1.5x and changes to `textPrimary` color, date label appears below (lines 1240-1254)
2. **Hero SARF canvas**: Highlight rings drawn around selected event's SARF data points (lines 1563-1602), relationship-only events get highlighted vertical lines
3. **Event band hover**: Background opacity increases from 0.08 to 0.25 on hover (line 1406)
4. **Event list row**: Row background changes to `highlightColor` when selected (line 2194)
5. **Cluster bar**: Selected bar gets full opacity vs 0.7 for unselected + border highlight (added in T3-2 session)

No additional changes needed.
