## Overview

This lecture covers two major components of Bowen theory:
1. **Nuclear Family Emotional System** — dynamics within the nuclear family unit
2. **Family Projection Process** — mechanism by which problems are projected to children

---

## Part A: Nuclear Family Emotional System

### Defining the Nuclear Family

- **Nuclear family** = father, mother, children (can include other household members)
- Nuclear family is embedded in extended family systems:
  - Father's family of origin (emotional unit)
  - Mother's family of origin (emotional unit)
- These are interlocked but have "some separateness"

**Diagram**:
```
[Father's Extended Family] ←→ [Nuclear Family] ←→ [Mother's Extended Family]
         (F-O)                (F, M, children)          (F-O)
```

### Characteristic of Emotional Systems

**Core principle**: "In the interchange between people, the problem comes to rest more in one person than another."

- Problems from distant parts of the system can be "pushed down into a corner and crystallized into a single person"
- This is characteristic of **any** emotional system, including families

### Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass (Term Evolution)

Bowen reflects on terminology:

**Verbatim**: "In the past, I've used the term undifferentiated family ego mass. Sometimes I wish that I hadn't used this term. It is misinterpreted in so many ways."

**Origin**:
- Started with symbiotic mother-child relationship research
- Found same kinds of relationships (less intense) running throughout family
- Used term for ease of communication

**Original meaning**: "The emotional stuck-togetherness that exists between family members"

**Current preference**: Bowen now uses:
- "Nuclear family system" (for nuclear family)
- "Extended family system" (for each parent's family of origin)
- "Family feels" (for total system)

### Two-Person System Dynamics

#### Energy Investment Model

**Verbatim**: "It is impossible for any two people to engage in any kind of task or activity without one being impinged by the other."

Intense husband-wife relationship as energy system:
- Husband invests psychic energy in wife
- Wife invests equal amount back
- **Psychic energy** = thinking time, fantasy energy, action energy

**Verbatim**: "What percentage of their psychic energy of their self is devoted to being the kind of a person the other wants them to be."

People can give percentage figures — "all the way up to 95 and 100 percent"

#### Giving and Receiving

**Verbatim**: "One of the concepts that I've sort of discarded in my family work is the concept of giving and receiving. I don't know what that means anymore."

Instead: "the giving of self somehow to the other self and it's receiving the self of the other"

#### Equilibrium and Instability

System stays in equilibrium when each person "meets the needs" of the other. Problem occurs when either is **incapable of fulfilling the contract**.

**Example**: Husband whose goal was "to give all of himself to his wife" — wife had same goal.

**Verbatim**: "If one devotes all of self... then how much self does one have."

This connects to:
- Lower on scale = more no-selfs
- Higher on scale = more clearly defined selves

#### Instability Mechanism

The giving of self is "interfered with by a host of reality things."

Most common disruption: **Addition of a third person (usually a child)**

**Mechanism**:
1. Mother gets pregnant
2. Energy she devoted to husband now directed to child (even before birth)
3. This quantitatively decreases the amount going to husband
4. Husband reacts "as if he's unloved"
5. Usual reaction: husband "gets mad and cuts himself off and goes out into relationships over here"
6. Mother gets emotionally involved with kids, father cut off

**Critical reminder**: Lower on scale = more intense this process; Higher on scale = less intense

### Leaving Family of Origin

#### Two Types of Departure

**Child with less intense emotional investment** (outside the family projection):
- "Grows away from the family ego mass"
- "Orderly growth process"
- Can "continue congenial relationships with his parents"
- "Parents can give up the child. He can give up the parents."
- "Free to go out and set up his own life and go forward with it"

**Child with intense emotional investment** (caught in projection):
- "So tightly involved that they can't grow away"
- Get away by "anger, hostility, running away, an attack, a denying of the intensity"
- Must "tear themselves away"
- Bowen calls these **"refugees"** from the family ego mass

**Verbatim**: "Nobody ever handles an emotional system by running away from it."

When refugees marry:
- They "immediately jam themselves together in a new emotional fusion"
- They "inherit a new problem"
- They "duplicate the same relationship pattern in the marriage that each had in the families of origin"

**Verbatim**: "For the husband what he essentially does is take the old relationship with the parents which is denied and it's dumped over into the marriage and the wife takes the one that she had to her parents and that's dumped into the marriage."

### Solid Self vs. Pseudo Self

**Diagram**:
```
HUSBAND                    WIFE
┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
│ Pseudo Self │           │ Pseudo Self │
│ (negotiable)│           │ (negotiable)│
├─────────────┤           ├─────────────┤
│ Solid Self  │           │ Solid Self  │
│ (non-neg.)  │           │ (non-neg.)  │
└─────────────┘           └─────────────┘
```

**Solid self**:
- "What they believe in, what they stand for, who they are"
- "Where they will stand no matter what"
- Never changes

**Pseudo self**:
- "Beliefs and philosophies that they acquire through education, reading"
- **"Negotiable"** — "under pressure from the environment... one can change one's pseudo self"

**In marriage**:
- Two people "fuse up to this point" — solid self not fused, pseudo self is
- Result: husband-dominated OR wife-dominated marriage
- One spouse's pseudo self "eclipsed" by the other
- The eclipsed one's solid self remains

**Example**: Husband whose pseudo self is eclipsed by wife:
- At work: can function at reasonable level of self
- In relationship to wife: becomes "fused" and she "makes the decisions and pretty much runs the life for the two of them"

### Distance as Adaptation

"By keeping the distance they can each keep more of a self."

Each spouse can:
- Back off from each other
- Keep distance
- Relate out there (outside relationships)
- Be "a little bit better self"

This is why outside relationships help maintain functioning.

## Part B: Three Ways of Handling Immaturity in Nuclear Family

**Key concept**: People entering marriage have "a quantitative amount of immaturity somehow to be handled in this relationship"

**Scale principle**: Higher on scale = less immaturity to handle; Lower = more

### The Three Mechanisms

**All three end up with symptoms**:

1. **Marital Conflict**
2. **Dysfunction in One Spouse**
3. **Projection of Problem to Child**

### 1. Marital Conflict

**Verbatim**: "I would see marital conflict as a way of these people maintaining the distance from each other."

**Pattern**:
- Get into fusion → get angry → separate
- "Fight and make up"
- Uncomfortable with distance → get too close → uncomfortable → fight → distance again

Conflict is a mechanism for managing closeness/distance.

### 2. Dysfunction in One Spouse

If one spouse stays in "eclipse position" long enough → vulnerable to **dysfunction**

**Three types of dysfunction**:
- **Physical illness**
- **Emotional illness**
- **Social illness** (drinking, non-productivity at work, trouble with police, etc.)

**Verbatim**: "I think the highest percentage of them develop physical illnesses, the next highest percentage emotional illness, and social dysfunction."

**Characteristic of emotional systems**: "When one person is impinged by the system, the system works better."

- Overt conflict throughout system
- One person gets sick
- Conflict settles down
- Illness becomes solidified

**Examples**: ulcer, asthma, arthritis, chronic illnesses

**Clinical observation**: When illness absorbs most of the immaturity:
- Marriage is calm
- Other spouse is healthy
- Husband only notices problem when wife goes into **dysfunction** (can no longer do her work)
- Couple wants therapy to "get symptoms decreased" — not motivated to change pattern
- Lower families stop therapy at symptom relief
- Higher families more motivated to work at it

### 3. Projection to Child

**Verbatim**: "The family deals with its problem, its immaturities, by projecting it forward into the next generation."

- Parents are more functional ones
- In time of stress, "voice the problem off on the kids"

**Verbatim**: "I think this runs in every family to some degree that this is this much of an important human phenomenon. So it's not a question of whether it exists or not, it's to what degree."

**Extreme example**: The autistic child
- Marriage is very calm
- Spouses are healthy
- Child is "totally incapacitated"
- Most difficult therapy prospect

### Quantitative Distribution

Bowen uses hypothetical "units" to illustrate:

**Example**: 60 units of immaturity
- If all absorbed in marital conflict → two healthy spouses, no projection to child
- If all absorbed in spouse illness → calm marriage, healthy kids, one dysfunctional spouse
- If all absorbed in projection → calm marriage, healthy spouses, impaired child

**Key insight**: "The more there is a mixture of the mechanisms the more hopeful this family for therapy."

- Family hasn't "solved its problem by sort of fixing it in one area"
- Immaturity is shared across mechanisms
- These do better in therapy

**Very low scale families**: Can have peak of all three simultaneously:
- Physical violence level conflict
- Serious physical illness in spouse
- Projection spread across all children

### Role of Cutoff from Family of Origin

**Critical relationship**:

**Verbatim**: "The more these two people stay cut off from this old intense relationship they had, the more intense the symptoms in whatever happens here."

- Doesn't change basic scale level
- Same basic level but **greater symptoms**
- More cutoff → more intense symptoms
- More open communication with families of origin → reduced tension in nuclear family

Even with cutoff from family of origin, outside relationships can decrease symptoms somewhat.

## Part C: Family Projection Process (Detailed)

### Mother as Primary Figure

**Verbatim**: "My theoretical postulation is that the mother is the sort of primary figure in this process."

- Mother has exposure to child in early years
- Mechanism operates through mother with father supporting
- **Exception**: When mother is sick/non-functioning, father takes over and can be primary figure

### Origin in Fantasy

The process "can begin by the time the mother first has fantasies and thoughts about having children"

**Development timeline**:
1. Adolescent fantasies about future children
2. Fantasies increase through years
3. After marriage, fantasies increase more
4. During pregnancy, really pick up

**Verbatim**: "Here's the mother's fantasy thinking system has already created a world for this child to which the child is going to have to conform long before the child's conceived."

### Two Types of Women (Based on Fantasy Focus)

**Type 1 — Fantasy focused on children**:
- Primary fantasy from adolescence = "kind of children she would eventually have"
- "Life energy is toward having children"
- "Getting married is a sort of a way of helping her toward this goal"
- More likely to become mother of schizophrenic

**Type 2 — Fantasy focused on husband**:
- Primary fantasy = "what kind of husbands will they have"
- "Don't think much about having children"
- Emotional self invested in husband
- "What's good about her husband eventually mostly what's wrong with her husband"
- More likely conflictual marriage

**Source**: Type is determined by relationship with her own parents (extended family)

### The Three-Step Process

**Verbatim**: "The mother's worry system goes through three steps which are the same three steps that medicine uses... examine the patient thoroughly, make a diagnosis, and then treat."

**Step 1 — Examine/Looking**:
- Worry comes into thinking: "Could this child be abnormal?"
- Looking, looking, looking for evidence

**Step 2 — Diagnose**:
- Sees some evidence
- Begins to diagnose/worry: "Is this so?"
- May take child to doctor at this point

**Physician danger**: Doctor can "aid and abet the family projection process and make the child chronically sick in the process of doing what he has been taught is good medicine"

**Step 3 — Treat**:
- Treats child as if diagnosis is true
- **Result**: Child becomes functionally impaired

**Verbatim**: "As soon as this happens the anxiety subsides up here just as in the two-person system when these people decide the sickness is in this one the anxiety subsides and now the sickness lights up."

### Mother's Anxiety as Driver

**Verbatim**: "This whole process the family projection process is motivated as I see it by mostly by anxiety in the mother."

- More anxious → more worrying about child
- Less anxious → less worrying
- She doesn't recognize it as anxiety
- It "focuses on doing good for the child"

**Father's role**: "Interested in keeping a non-anxious wife and he'll do almost anything to make his wife calm, calmer so he sort of supports this."

### Creating Defects from Nothing

**Verbatim**: "The mother's worry system can create a defect here out of old cloth in which there is none."

**Example**:
- Worry: "He is unusually childish"
- Diagnosing: saying it
- Treating: treating him as if he's childish
- **Result**: "In fact he is more immature"

**Or amplifying real defects**:
- Congenital abnormality exists
- Mother knows about it
- Worry focuses on it
- "This whole emotional process begins to fix on that"
- Makes it worse

**Verbatim**: "It's like a drop of water drop at a time a drop at a time over a long enough period of time sort of creates this in the child."

### Which Child Gets Selected?

**Usually one primary child**, but can include second, third...

**Factors that govern selection**:
- Oldest (statistically more common)
- Youngest
- Oldest boy or oldest girl
- Youngest boy or youngest girl
- Child with physical defect
- Mother's focus (e.g., "emotional self would focus more on boys")

**Pattern in families**:
- One child = most impaired
- Another = second most impaired
- Some = "relatively out of it" — most mature, highest differentiation

**Some families**: Process fastens on first child, then when another born, lets first go and fastens on new child — goes down the line.

### Outcome: Different Parents to Different Children

**Verbatim**: "These two people to this child are different than they are to this child."

This explains why siblings with same parents have different outcomes:
- Child caught in projection → impaired
- Child outside projection → mature, doing well
- Same parents, different relationship

Old psychiatry explanation didn't account for this — assumed "passive father, aggressive castrating mother" explains impaired child, but can't explain why sibling is mature.
