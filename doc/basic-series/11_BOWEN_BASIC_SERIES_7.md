## Overview

This lecture is a videotaped interview between Bowen and Kathleen Yanks, a faculty member at the Family Center. Kathy has been working on bridging cutoffs in her own highly cut-off family for years. The interview provides detailed clinical examples of cutoff manifestations across generations, including the emotional events around her son's christening.

**Unique format**: Unlike the lecture-style presentations of Parts 1-6, this is a clinical interview demonstrating cutoff concepts through a real family system.

---

## Part A: Family Structure Overview

### The Nuclear Family

**Parents**: Living in Florida
- Father and mother from Georgia (both families)
- "Real cut off" from extended families

**Four children**:
1. **Mary** (oldest): "Real emotionally involved with and tied to her mother"; married twice, several children
2. **Brother (Paul)**: Lived fairly close to parents most of life, now lives away
3. **Tim**: Had epilepsy, died 13-14 years ago; widow and children live near parents but "sort of cut off from the family"
4. **Kathy** (youngest): Joined religious order early in life, left ~8 years ago, married, adopted son ~11 months prior to interview

### Bowen's Assessment

**Verbatim**: "We know that this family has existed as a kind of an emotional unit from the time of their marriage until now."

**On Kathy's work**: "For a family with this much cutoff, she has been rather successful... Of course, working with such a family is much more difficult than the average family."

---

## Part B: The Christening Event — Detailed Clinical Material

### Background and Planning

Kathy initially planned to have son Brian baptized in Maryland, inviting parents and siblings.

**Mother's response**: "She wouldn't come."

Kathy then moved it to Florida, asking sister and brother to be godparents.

**Kathy's rationale** (Verbatim): "I believe when my parents die, my generation is ripe for cutting off even more than my parents did. So that this would be one way of tying, assisting the relationship with my brother and sister."

Both siblings agreed; parents agreed to host reception.

### Arrival in Florida

**Mother didn't meet them at plane** — father did.
- Mother's stated reason: "Allergic to airports"
- Bowen: "Maybe just the ones where her daughter arrived"

**Son Brian's responses**:
- Laughed, had fun with grandfather immediately
- "A real frightened look on his face when he met my mother again"

### Mother's Reactivity — Sequence of Events

**Event 1: Food announcement** (within 3 hours of arrival)
"My mother did a very sharp and clear description of how she planned to manage the food while I was there. And that she would cook it at certain times and I could eat it or not."

**Contrast to convent days**: "This is in a real contrast to before I left the convent. The house was almost upside down by the time I arrived in order to please me when I was in the convent."

**Event 2: Crying baby at meal**
- Baby started crying, Kathy attended him (15-20 minutes)
- Knew family pattern: "It's best to ignore them"
- Returned to cold food, mother told her to eat it
- Kathy reminded mother of her own statement about cooking/eating flexibility
- Refused to eat cold food

**Event 3: Overheard phone call** (critical incident)
Kathy overheard mother on phone with brother Paul, "talking in a low tone":
- Mother saying Joe (Kathy's husband) "irked her"
- That he "could well have waited" till following day to arrive
- Mother repeated it because brother couldn't hear

**Kathy's response**: "I really developed a twitch... got real tearful real quickly"

**Confrontation**: Kathy told mother she and Joe would go to motel.
- Mother "got real uptight"
- "Denied saying anything that I heard"
- "Shaking her fist in my face"
- "Telling these not to yell. And I was not yelling. I knew that."

**Verbatim**: "I'm often confused thinking I must be doing what she's saying I'm doing. But I knew I wasn't doing it."

**Father's response** when Kathy discussed with him: "My mother was getting forgetful. She didn't really mean what she was saying."

**Bowen notes this as pattern**: "He would excuse her. He would find a reason that she would do things in it."

**Event 4: Reception planning anxiety**
Mother asked repeatedly (at least three times): "Now who are you inviting? Who are these people?"
- Kathy repeated: family, high school friends, some nuns
- Mother: "I thought you'd invite some strange people"
- Connection to wedding anxiety — "Some strange people were at the wedding. Some of my friends she'd never met before."

**Father-mother conflict over food**:
- Kathy wanted substantial food (time of day required it)
- Mother wanted "little pick up things that don't amount to much"
- Father stepped in: "This was his gift to Brian... get what I wanted"
- Mother "really reacted to that"

### The Saturday Gathering

**First time family together in 13 years** — since Tim's death in 1967.

Present: Parents, siblings (Mary, Paul, Kathy), some nieces and nephews

**Observed dynamics**:
- Sister Mary: "Chattering"
- Brother Paul: "Clam up more and more... one or two word comment... real uptight"
- Father: "Just kind of eating... didn't contribute much"

**Father's pattern**: "He usually doesn't. He gets sort of overwhelmed with the chattering."

**Verbatim (on father's role)**: "He would move in if she got too uptight... If it had to do with one of us talking to her in a way that he thought was making her more nervous, he'd get in to say, shut up. Be quiet."

### Brother Paul's Drinking

**Verbatim**: "My brother drinks very well."

Pattern:
- "Anytime he's with the family, he is usually drinking"
- Beer when with family (mother's tolerance), hard liquor at home
- "He'd start about 11 in the morning public with that and go right on through the day"
- "They went through many cases on beer" during the weekend

**Who drank**: Paul most, then father, then Kathy; sister "nip here and there"; mother = teetotaler

### Mother's Calming Pattern

**Verbatim**: "My mother is a very good hostess. She's wonderful with outsiders. She's delightful. Makes you feel warm and welcome."

Reception: Mother calmed down, went into hostess mode
- "It's difficult to tell if she's calming down or if she automatically goes into being a cordial hostess"
- "She's socially correct in a social situation"

---

## Part C: The Tim Family Cutoff

### Current State

Tim's widow and children: "Sort of cut off from the family"

**Tim Jr.**: Becomes substitute for Tim Sr.
**Verbatim**: "More and more, my parents are treating Tim Jr. as though he's Tim Sr. And that's just very clear to me except that they are less uptight and nicer to Tim Jr."

**Distance increasing**: "The distance between your parents and Tim's children is greater and greater."

### Mother's Denial

**Conversation where mother volunteered**: "Tim's boys go to see Mary all the time"

**Kathy's response**: "I told her I didn't believe that. They don't behave that way."

**Father contradicted mother**: "That wasn't true. That the relationship between the boys and this family is lousy."

**Mother insisting**: "It's good. It's good. And they know they're welcomed."

### Bowen's Observation

**Verbatim**: "Your mother gets into a lot of flat-footed statement of fact. Flat-footed statements which contradict facts."

"Everything is wonderful. While the action would be the opposite. Very much the opposite."

**When contradicted**: Mother shook fist in Kathy's face, denied saying something said 30 seconds prior.

---

## Part D: Mother's Social vs. Family Functioning

### The Drugstore Pattern

**Verbatim**: Mother "goes to Mass every morning. She comes home and cooks breakfast for him. And then goes down and eats breakfast in the drugstore down the street. He does not know that."

Joe (Kathy's husband) witnessed: "She was entertaining everyone in the area. Apparently, a number of cronies meet down there, and she was having a delightful time, being very cordial."

**Father's ignorance**: "She says she's going to the grocery store."

**Verbatim**: "I do. I think she does [keep it secret]... if he found out, he wouldn't say anything to her."

### Community Recognition

**Verbatim**: Mother is "known around Orlando as a wonderful, charitable person. Won an award for being so wonderful and charitable. You know, an award that big-name people in Orlando won."

### The Fundamental Split

**Bowen's observation**: "She can go out there and do all those things. But she sure can talk to her kids or her brothers and sisters."

---

## Part E: The Golden Wedding Anniversary (1978)

### Setup

50th anniversary — July 12, 1978
Kathy told parents a year in advance; planned to invite extended family.

### Parental Response

**Verbatim**: "Middle of June I got a letter from my father saying they were going to Ireland and that they would be there during July 12."

**First trip ever to Ireland**, during their 50th anniversary, alone.

### Kathy's Response

Changed the date, "rewrote all these people"
**Verbatim**: "We'll nab them when they get off the plane."
"I thought, you know, damn, they are really running away from this. How many, how far, how many times will they run?"

### Who Showed Up

- Mother's stepsister (from California) — hadn't seen since 1957 (grandmother's funeral), before that 1940s (told to "go back to California, your children need you" — was in house "an hour")
- Younger stepbrother
- Mother's girlfriend
- None from father's side (wedding conflict in Savannah)

**Siblings**: Brother forgot; sister got to Kansas or similar

### The Event

Renewed vows in convent chapel, mass, dinner.

**Conflict over flowers**: Mother and Kathy argued about flowers on altar.
**Father stepped in**: "You be quiet. She's planning this. You let her do it."

---

## Part F: Historical Cutoff Patterns

### Mother's Family of Origin

**Mother's parents' marriage**:
- Father (Daniel Graham): "The cutoff... is about the most complete I have. I've hardly been able to budge that."
- Only found full name via death certificate
- Church records burned; cemetery complications

**Mother's grandmother and her brothers**:
- "They not wanting to see her. She wanted to see them, but they didn't want to see her."
- "A number of alcoholics... three or four of those boys died early on at various young ages"

**Verbatim**: "So that side of the family, the cutoffs are more complete, which I think has, certainly influences my mother's anxiety, reactivity, inability to deal with anything except if it's confined within a very small box."

### Father's Family

**Father's semi-cutoff**: "To please my mother"

**Father's relationship with siblings**: "Stayed in touch with his siblings. Not with their children."

**Mother's stories about father's family** (Verbatim): "Those are some of the most clear stories I remember about my father. Was how nutty he is to go back into Savannah with those crazy brothers of his. You know, all he does is go back there and drink, drink, drink, and come home sick. And I have to clean up all this mess."

### Contrast: Pinckney vs. Bowen Reunions

**Pinckney reunion** (father's mother's family): "Calmer. There were something like 500 people there. Went real well."

**Cousins reunion**: "So much alcohol was needed to keep them in the same motel. And they started breaking doors down. You know, doing real reactive stuff."

### Wedding Day Cutoff

**Verbatim**: "On their wedding day, they moved to Florida. That was part of the honeymoon. And my mother's cut off from Savannah since. Almost never went back."

One trip: "Went back with Mary to show her off. Then got kind of bogged down."

---

## Part G: Kathy's Role in the Family System

### Original Position

Youngest by 5.5 years from Tim.

**Roles**:
- Peacemaker between mother and sister
- Buffer around tension (mother and father)
- "Something like special sitting on a shelf that they could point to from time to time"

### The Messenger Role

**Verbatim**: "My mother would tell me what to say to my father about issues important to her. And one would be his drinking, go tell your dad how bad it is for him to drink. Then, with my sister, go tell her to use her head and think about what she's doing and stop raising her kids in such a crazy way."

"It would be say the right things and be nice and pleasant."

### Special Relationship with Tim

"He was home longer while I was there... easier to talk to... I felt a lot closer to him than the others."

---

## Part H: The Convent as Cutoff

### Motivation to Enter

**Verbatim**: "Part of it was not wanting to deal with the uptightness I saw my sister go through when she hit adolescence. That was very negative. Very uptight. A lot of yelling. I didn't want to go through that."

"Something would have to do with the peace, you know, peace in quotes that I would observe there in the convent."

### Mother's Response to Announcement

**Verbatim**: "When I told my mother about it, the change in, she usually made my clothes. And they were nice, you know, I looked all right. After I told her that, she bought only the best."

Kathy: "Look, this is crazy. I'm only going to wear them for a year."
Mother: "That's all right, that's all right."

**Verbatim**: "My mother was very relieved and felt secure with me there."

### Response to Leaving Convent

**Stated**: "Live your own life... We've always said live your own life. So do what you have to do."

**Behavioral reality**: "Going home, almost to the point of being ignored. When it was, I was so over-focused on when I got, when I visited while I was in the convent."

"After I have left and when I go home, it's, well, we're going to keep on doing what we're doing. And we're going to go somewhere."

**Sister relationship**: "The negative stuff between my sister and my eye has really gotten intense... I think that has to do with my mother's uptightness about me being back in the family."

---

## Part I: The Work on Family — Internal Resistance

### The Core Challenge

**Verbatim**: "Working on this kind of a family for you is much harder than a less cut off family."

**Kathy's response**: "The resistance within me is great."

**Bowen clarifies**: "In other words, there's the cut off... plus the resistance in you."

**Kathy**: "I built the cut off."

### Bowen's Assessment

**Verbatim**: "I do believe that your work on the family probably has been maybe the most profitable thing you ever did."

**Kathy confirms**: "I believe that. The flexibility that's in me now is greater. It's not great, but it certainly is greater. To be able to think about choices, life."

### Changes Achieved

**Relationship with father**: "I have sifted out the comments by my mother about him and know him more now for what he is and who he is."

**Relationship with brother**: "Beginning to be."

**Godparent strategy worked**: Brother came with comment that he didn't want to cut off.

---

## Part J: Bowen's Key Observations Throughout

### On Cut-Off Families and Social Success

**Verbatim**: "The people who are cut off will make a big thing out of their social relationships. And I don't think you need a better example of that than your mother."

"She does very well in social things, recognized for it, but in her own family she is uptight, uptight, and gone forever."

### On Anxiety and Moving

**Verbatim**: "A very anxious wife whose, the husband goes along with it. And the amount of moving around these families can do to calm her down. To calm the anxiety."

### On Multigenerational Cutoff Discovery

**Verbatim** (on genealogical research revealing cutoffs): "When the grandfather, and that's 130 years ago, 135 or 40, so, you know, long generations, whose parents died when he was a teenager... the younger siblings went to live with different people. And those were hard for me to track... it wasn't so much of a negative cutoff... except they just had no more contact. And then after a century or a century and a quarter, it's hard to find out who they were."

### On Mary and Future Cutoff

**Verbatim**: "You ended up with a thing with a real intense symbiotic attachment between your mother and Mary. She's gone through two marriages, having problems with her kids, with some kind of an indication that, well, you've said it here. That when these are dead, these two will be cut off."
