## Context: Bowen's Theoretical Positioning

Bowen opens by positioning his theory relative to other approaches in the family field. He draws a spectrum:

```
CONVENTIONAL THEORY ←————————————————————————→ SYSTEMS THEORY

Conventional side:
├── Psychoanalytic (traditional psychiatric reference)
├── Group Therapy (family as group)
└── Encounter/Marathon/Sensitivity Training (getting feelings expressed)

Systems side:
├── Communication Theory (Jackson and group)
└── Bowen's Natural Systems Theory (broader, biological)
```

**Critical distinction**: Bowen explicitly separates his work from "general systems" — he sees the family as "an organism, a biological organism" and frames his theory as characteristic of **natural systems**. This is not abstract systems theory; it's grounded in biology.

**Verbatim**: "I see the family as an organism, a biological organism, and that the system that I'm trying to define is more characteristic of natural systems."

## Series Overview: Seven Sections

Bowen announces the theoretical structure of the full series:

1. **Triangles** (this lecture)
2. **Scale of Differentiation of Self** (this lecture)
3. **Nuclear Family Dynamics**
4. **Family Projection Process** — "one of the most important in the whole family field"
5. **Multigenerational Transmission Process** — "how the family process transmit predictably from generation to the next to the next, how these things repeat and repeat and repeat"
6. **Sibling Positions**
7. **I Position and Differentiation of Self**

After theoretical sections: techniques of family therapy.

**Bowen's caveat**: "It's impossible really to package these various sections. It's impossible to talk about one without talking about the other."

---

## Part A: Triangle Theory

### The Triangle as Molecule

**Core claim**: "My theoretical system considers the triangle as the molecule, as the unit of any emotional system whether it be in the family, in the social system, wherever."

- Any emotional system = series of interlocking triangles
- Triangle = unit, molecule, basis of the theory
- **Therapy = modification of the triangle**

**Verbatim**: "Modify the triangle and you have modified the system."

### Why "Triangle" Not "Triad"

Bowen deliberately chose "triangle" over the more familiar "triad" because triad has fixed connotations. He acknowledges the term is "a little geometric" but it signals something different from conventional triad thinking.

### Thinking in Systems vs. Individual

**Nuclear family system**: Father, mother, children — a unit of the total family system.

**Extended family systems**:
- Father's extended family = emotional unit (remains so even if members separate, marry, move away)
- Mother's extended family = emotional unit

**Diagram**:
```
[Father's Extended Family] ←→ [Nuclear Family] ←→ [Mother's Extended Family]
         (emotional unit)     (F, M, children)      (emotional unit)
```

**Conventional thinking**: Symptom in nuclear family → explain via individual dynamics (id, ego, superego). Family is "sort of out there and off the focus."

**Systems thinking**: Don't focus on symptom — focus on the **whole field**. What's going on in extended family influences nuclear family. "Systems thinking is an effort to get the whole field in."

**Verbatim**: "And to be thinking of the whole field rather than the symptoms there."

### Triangle Replaces Oedipal Theory

Bowen explicitly states he uses **triangle theory to replace conventional Oedipal theory**:

- Oedipal theory "does about the same thing"
- Triangle theory gives "much more latitude" and is "much more predictable"
- Oedipal thinking pulls you back toward individual theory, away from larger family theory

### Characteristics of Triangles

#### Two-Person System Instability

**Verbatim**: "A two person system is basically an unstable system. A two person system can stay in harmony as long as things are calm. But get a two person system under stress and it will triangle in a third person."

A three-person system can stay in harmony **as long as it becomes a triangle**.

#### Calm State vs. Tension State

**Calm state**:
- Triangle = twosome (togetherness) + outsider
- Preferred position = member of the togetherness
- A and B are "friends," C is outside

**Tension state**:
- Preferred position = **outside position**
- "Let you two fight and let me stay out of it"

#### Constant Motion

**Verbatim**: "The emotional forces are in a constant state of motion and fluctuation in a triangle. It's never still. It's moving from moment to moment."

- Over long periods: patterns persist
- Moment to moment: always shifting
- Always forming twosome + excluding other, or separating in times of stress

#### The Uncomfortable One Makes the Move

In low tension states, usually one person is uncomfortable in the twosome:
- One spouse: "I've been uncomfortable for years"
- Other spouse: "It's been wonderful, I never knew there was anything wrong"

The comfortable one is usually surprised the other is uncomfortable.

#### Triangling Mechanism (Detailed Example)

A and B go to lunch. A is uncomfortable.

**Comfortable state**: A talks to B about self and about B — "person to person relationship"

**Bowen's observation**: "Most people in the average relationship can't stand too much person to person relationship. What they do is make it more comfortable by talking about things or by triangling in a third person."

**Mechanism**:
1. A (uncomfortable) tells B a negative story about mutual friend C
2. This makes A and B "buddy buddies" — "We two understand each other and now we're going to talk about that character over there"
3. B meets C in the hall, looks at C differently
4. Now negative side shifts: was A-B uncomfortable, now B-C uncomfortable
5. A-B relationship becomes calm and positive

**Pattern**: Two calm sides, one uncomfortable/negative side

#### Interlocking Triangles

When B and C fail to shift tension back:
- They triangle in a fourth person D
- New triangle B-C-D forms
- Original A-B-C triangle becomes **latent**

**Verbatim**: "In a triangle system, the emotional system can jump to one triangle and then it can suddenly flip over to another."

As you add more people:
- Tension system can be "transmitted out" from parents to kids
- "The problem between the parents, which started up here, is fought out between the kids"
- Same happens in offices: boss conflict fought out between subordinates

#### Administrative Response (Wrong Approach)

Administration makes judgment about who's "at fault," disciplines one, fires them, puts them in psychotherapy. Add another person — system still operates. Take out that person — tension goes somewhere else.

### Bowen's Therapeutic Approach

**Verbatim**: "If I was working, if this is a family, I would not put a therapeutic focus on these two people or on either one of them."

- Conventional psychiatry: pick the sick one, treat that one
- More systems approach: these two are equally involved, focus on both
- **Bowen's approach**: "Go back up to the two head people in the system and work with them"

### Primary Family Triangles

1. **Husband + His Parents** — basic triangle from birth, patterns over years
2. **Wife + Her Parents** — same
3. **In-Law Triangles**:
   - Husband + Wife + Husband's Parents (wife-in-laws = negative side)
   - Husband + Wife + Wife's Parents (husband-in-laws = negative side)
4. **Father + Mother + Child** — "most important triangle"

**Triangle count by family size**:
- 3 people → 1 triangle
- 4 people → 4 triangles
- 5 people → ~9 primary triangles
- 6 people → ~15 triangles
- Goes up rapidly with more people
- Plus secondary triangles (people grouping around one corner)

### Sibling Rivalry Reframed

**Bowen's claim**: "Most of sibling rivalry has to do with this triangle between the mother and her two children in which this side is positive and this and the tension is acted out between the children."

This is "a different way of thinking about it than we think about it with the Oedipal system."

### Cellular Metaphor for Triangle Motion

Bowen offers an alternative to geometric thinking:

**Verbatim**: "If you'd think of this as some kind of cellular solution of cells that's sort of agglutinate in three little clumps and then they'll break up and go to others, say it would be some kind of a system that you have a kind of a charge on it. And with a certain level of charge then this system forms into one pattern and then with a different charge it'll suddenly reform."

**Clinical observation**: In family therapy with multiple kids:
1. Parent speaks to child, child on defensive
2. Child says "You haven't seen anything yet. You should have seen what he did."
3. Focus shifts to other child
4. Pattern moves from triangle to triangle

---

## Part B: Scale of Differentiation of Self

### Purpose of the Scale

**Verbatim**: "This is one of the most important aspects of this theoretical system."

Goals:
- Get away from concept of "normal" in psychiatry
- "Normal has never been defined. I don't think it ever will be defined."
- Normal usually means average — but how define average/exceptional?
- Put **whole scale of human functioning on one long spectrum**

### Scale Parameters

**Range**: 0 to 100 (arbitrary — "any kind of scale is all right, as long as one can get the notion of a continuum")

**Bowen's self-critique**: "I'm not liking this scale as I go through the years with it because I'm finding most of society fits into this segment of it. Finding very few people that go above this as I have defined it."

### Lower Half (0-50): Feeling Orientation

**Verbatim**: "The lower half of the scale goes increasingly toward a feeling orientation to life."

- Feelings fused with intellect
- "When you get down in here it can't separate them"

**Characteristics**:
- Live in completely immersed feeling world
- High percentage of life energy in relating to/reacting to others
- "Much of their time in an effort to love and be loved or they're mad at the other because they're not loved"

**Very lowest part**:
- So miserable, spending most time just getting comfortable
- Not even aware of feelings — "just know they're miserable"
- "Much of their energy goes just to getting comfortable"
- Can't think about tomorrow, next week, next year
- "The here and now is so miserable and so pressing that they live in the here and now"

### Upper Half (50-100): Thinking/Feeling Separation

**Above midpoint**:
- Awareness that there is a difference between feeling and intellect
- Increasing awareness up the scale
- "People high up the scale have well-defined feeling systems and separate well-defined intellectual systems"

**Critical point**: When separated, **both systems are free**:
- "When the feeling system and the intellectual system are separate, then the feeling system can be free, and so can the intellectual system be free"
- Lower half: feelings are "a prisoner" — fused state is "an unfree state"

**Addressing the misconception**: People thought Bowen was describing "cold, non-feeling person"

**Verbatim**: "When the intellect is separate, separate from the emotions, from the feelings, then the feelings can be free. So the person high up the scale is free to be very close to other people. They can move in and move out. They can have a close relationship or they can get along without it. People down here don't have that choice. They can't get along without it."

### Feeling vs. Thinking Confusion

**Verbatim**: "One of the things that I have made a major point of and all the time I've been working in family and in the theoretical part of it is the degree to which people do not differentiate between feelings and thoughts."

- Lower on scale → harder to differentiate
- People say "I feel that" when they mean "I think that" or "I believe that"
- Lower people will "almost excuse themselves for saying I believe. And they say I should have said I feel that."

### Mid-Scale Characteristics (50-75 range)

**Budding intellectual system still bogged in feeling system**:
- Dogmatic beliefs
- Selection of belief determined by feelings
- "The rebel belongs in here" — doesn't have thinking system of own, reacting emotionally to other, being opposite of other

### Upper Scale Characteristics (75+)

**Political/diplomatic segment**: Have fairly clear distinction between thinking and feeling, but make decisions favoring feeling system "because they would make somebody angry if they said what they thought"

**Very top of scale** (Bowen: "I don't know anybody up there"):
- Very clear about what they believe and what they feel
- Decisions based on belief and conviction (not feelings)
- Kept scale high "because I want it to be far out... to what man might be capable later on"

**Verbatim**: "I think this is what makes man different from the rest of the animal world. In other words, this part of the system obeys the laws of nature. And then man with his intellect is able to get out of that and to gain a little control over this with his intellect."

### Scale and Emotional Illness

**Critical clarification**: The scale "has nothing to do with emotional illness"

- Institutional population (can't function in life, prisons, mental hospitals) = lower part of scale
- "Most of the people with real hardcore psychosis, schizophrenia belong down in this part of the scale"
- Parents of these people = "a little bit higher up the scale"

**But**:
- "There are a lot of people way down the scale who keep life in pretty good equilibrium"
- Under stress, they can break down and remain mentally ill
- "People fairly high up the scale can be put under sufficient pressure that they will have a brief breakdown and will pretty much recover themselves"

**Verbatim**: "It's not that this is free of emotional illness and this has it. It's all up and down the scale except the chronic difficult type is down here."

### Functional vs. Basic Level of Self

**Major complexity**: "Functional levels of self"

People in lower half can borrow/lend/trade self:
- "One can borrow a self, borrow some ideas from another person and appear to be more of a self than they are"
- Greater borrowing/lending at lower end of scale

**Seesaw phenomenon**:
- Two people marry at same basic level
- Shortly after: one functioning better than other
- "One goes up sort of at the expense of the other"
- One = over-functioning, other = under-functioning
- Both have same **basic level of self**

**Verbatim**: "It is terribly hard to fix definite levels in the lower half of the scale because of this borrowing and lending of self that goes on all the time as these triangles move in and move out."

## Part C: Mother-Child Investment Diagram

Bowen presents a schematic (acknowledges "hard to find a family exactly like this" — done to illustrate theory):

```
                    MOTHER
                   /      \
                  /        \
           HIGH INVESTMENT   LOW INVESTMENT
           (anxiety-driven)  (reality-driven)
                /                  \
               /                    \
          DAUGHTER                  SON
        (no-self, low              (good self,
         differentiation)          higher differentiation)
```

### High Investment Child

**Psychic energy** = thinking, feeling, action, energy

**Verbatim**: "A high percentage of this mother's psychic energy, psychic energy would be thinking, feeling, action, energy."

**Critical equivalence**: "A negative feeling is just as successful in maintaining a family system as a positive feeling... For systems purposes, negative and positive energy is equivalent."

**Characteristics of high-investment relationship**:
- Starts before birth (mother thinking about child, planning life for child)
- Child invests equal amount back in mother
- "Symbiotic relationship... in all degrees of intensity"

**Consequences**:
- Child is "extension of mother"
- Mother's self is "hooked on to this child"
- Child's energy "not free to go forward with life"
- Child "invested in worrying about mother":
  - Is she there?
  - Is she all right?
  - Will she always be there?
  - Does she love me?

**Behavioral pattern**:
- Child can't go out and play
- Mother tries to help → child plays while mother there → mother sneaks away → child returns to mother
- "The more the mother pushes the child away, the more the child clings"

### Low Investment Child

- Mother's thinking/energy "determined more by reality than by anxiety"
- "Determined more by the needs of the child"
- Mother does things for child when child needs it
- "Not this worry, glorifying preoccupation with the child"

**Consequences**:
- Child "relatively free of mother's self"
- Free to go exploring the world
- **Goal-directed activity**
- Energy free to go forward with life

### Universal Presence of Pattern

**Verbatim**: "I think most mothers have some degree of this with at least one child."

- Family high up scale: some degree of this, but child not too impaired
- Family lower on scale: child will be severely impaired later in life
- "This process runs at all levels of differentiation of self"
- Scale level predicts "what kind of problems this child will have"

### School Phobia Example

High-investment child:
- School phobia = "hooked to mother, can't get unhooked"
- In school: more interested in relating to/being loved by teacher, then peers
- Same pattern reproduces in later relationships

Low-investment child:
- "Can't wait to get to school"
- Interested in learning

**School teacher anecdote**: Teacher at feeling end of scale says:
- "I do very well with these children... they give something to me and I give back something"
- "These, I don't get along so well with those little brains. They're just interested in learning."

### Adolescent Cutoff and Pattern Transfer

**Verbatim**: "Generally it breaks down at about adolescence and that's the time that the child begins to see the parent as a square or they're mean or what have you."

- Parent starts nagging
- Relationship cutoff
- Child "will go immediately into another relationship in which the same pattern continues"
- Same pattern of life energy invested back and forth

**Post-cutoff**:
- Involvement with clubs, gangs, cliques
- If doesn't get social invitation: crushed (high-investment child) vs. has other things to do (low-investment child)

### Marriage Pattern Repetition

Diagram:
```
[Wife's Parents] ←→ [Wife ←→ Husband] ←→ [Husband's Parents]
     cutoff ↘         marriage          ↙ cutoff
              ↘                        ↙
               ↘    [MARRIAGE]       ↙
                ↘  same pattern    ↙
                 ↘  dumped here  ↙
```

**Verbatim**: "It's this relationship with the parents dumped over into this. And for the wife, it's this relationship dumped into this one. So now you have the old relationship with parents duplicated in the marriage."

### Instability of the Twosome

**Verbatim**: "It is very hard to keep this relationship in equilibrium. This involves so much giving of self to the other and the other giving of self back and nobody missing a step that that's what I've called the unstable twosome."

### Friend Selection by Scale Level

- Person at one end doesn't pick person at other end as friend
- "Lifestyles are so different that they're incompatible"
- People pick friends with same lifestyle "in terms of this feeling relating to the other, loving and being loved, giving self to the other"
- Same-level people marry each other

### Pregnancy and Marital Rebalancing

**Mechanism**:
1. Wife gets pregnant
2. Fair amount of life energy goes to baby (before birth)
3. Takes away from amount she gives husband
4. "Her husband feels it, he's thinking she doesn't love him"
5. Husband reacts
6. **Average pattern**: husband gets cut off, wife caught up again with child

**Betty Friedan's point** (Feminine Mystique): mothers should have goals of their own

**Bowen's response**: "What does it take to change the pattern of this life toward the pattern of that life? That's sort of what the therapy in this system would do."

**What Friedan missed**: "The fathers have the exact same pattern, only the fathers often handle it by getting involved with boss or work with the very same pattern they had up here. Or if that doesn't work they can have affairs."

### Multigenerational Transmission Preview

**Scale impact**:
- High-investment child = "much lower on the scale than mother because mother is sort of using this child"
- Same-level-as-mother child possible
- Outside-the-system child = "higher up the scale"

**Verbatim**: "People are born at higher, they're not born there, but they come out of the family and out of childhood with varying levels of differentiation depending on how much they are caught up into this family emotional mass."

## Synthesis Notes (Preliminary)

### Triangle as Decision Point

The triangle is not just a relational structure — it's a **decision-making unit**. Each shift in the triangle is a decision point:
- Who to align with?
- Whether to absorb or transmit tension?
- Whether to triangle in a fourth?

This maps to the DecisionPoint schema being developed in the synthesis.

### Scale as Tuning Parameter

Bowen's scale parallels Couzin's neural tuning parameter (ν):
- Low scale = strong default to feeling/relationship orientation = high ν equivalent
- High scale = capacity to use intellect independently = lower ν, more deliberation possible
- The ~30% exception (Couzin's strong-default individuals) may map to those at scale extremes

### Borrowing/Lending Self as Collective Decision-Making

Bowen's observation that people in lower half of scale borrow/lend self parallels Couzin's collective integration of social information. The functional level fluctuations in a marriage are analogous to collective decision dynamics.

### Implicit Model in Scale Terms

Stinson's implicit model = what behavior reveals (not what you say)
Bowen's scale = degree to which implicit (feeling) vs. explicit (thinking) dominates

The person low on scale IS their implicit model — feeling and intellect are fused, no separation allows no explicit override. Person high on scale has capacity to have explicit model that differs from implicit.
