## Overview

This lecture integrates previous concepts into a comprehensive model of symptom development. Bowen presents four governing variables and details the three types of dysfunction in a spouse (physical, emotional, social), with extensive discussion of programming from families of origin.

**Key structural insight**: The lecture title in the index said "Triangles in Therapy" but the actual content is "Symptom Development" — a more comprehensive integration of variables governing nuclear family symptoms.

---

## Part A: The Four Governing Variables

### Opening Statement

**Verbatim**: "A number of variables govern the developments, development of symptoms in the nuclear family."

The four variables:
1. **Operational/functional level of differentiation of self**
2. **Fixed relationship patterns in the family**
3. **Degree to which the family maintains viable emotional contact with past generations**
4. **Anxiety**

### Variable 1: Level of Differentiation

**Verbatim**: "These come into a marriage with a level of differentiation of self which I hope someday we will have sufficiently defined to fix a fairly reliable numerical value to it. I think that's achievable."

Core principle:
- More undifferentiated = more undifferentiation to be handled by family organism
- Better differentiated = less undifferentiation to be handled

**Verbatim**: "People come into a marriage with a definite amount of this."

### Variable 2: Relationship Patterns (Four Main Patterns)

**Verbatim**: "The way they handle this in a marriage has to do with the patterns, relationship patterns. There are four main relationship patterns."

1. **Distance between spouses**
2. **Marital conflict**
3. **Sickness or dysfunction in a spouse** (characteristically one spouse)
4. **Transmission of parental problem to one or more children** (family projection process)

### The Fusion Dynamic

**Verbatim**: "Depending on the degree to which they are differentiated they will fuse into a certain amount of weenus which is either male dominated or female dominated."

Two fusion patterns:
- **Male dominated fusion**: Wife appended to husband
- **Female dominated fusion**: Husband appended to wife

**Function of distance**: "The emotional distance helps them to control the intensity or the discomfort of the fusion."

---

## Part B: Marital Conflict Pattern

### Unique Characteristics

**Verbatim**: "Marital conflict is sufficiently different that it can be almost in a category by itself."

**Verbatim**: "These are people who are emotionally focused on each other. So emotionally focused on each other that no matter what else happens in the family these people are thinking about and reacting with each other. It's probably the most intense relationship in families."

Pattern: "The most intense level of togetherness followed by separation, distance, coming back together. So it's an alternating relationship."

**Verbatim**: "Even in their most negative phases they are thinking about and focused on each other."

### Origin in Family of Origin

**Verbatim**: "As I see it, that came out of a family of origin in which intense emotional closeness was sort of the mode of adapting."

---

## Part C: Dysfunction in a Spouse — Three Types

### General Characteristics

**Verbatim**: "These three ways of dealing with dysfunction in a spouse are different. They're the same, but they're different."

**Direction of symptoms**:
- Husband dominated fusion → symptoms in wife
- Wife dominated fusion → symptoms in husband

**Verbatim**: "In the intensity of the fusion, one is done in by the fusion. They come to a state of dysfunction."

### Peace-Agree Families

**Verbatim**: "These are people as a group who are programmed as what we call peace agree families. They would sacrifice all kinds of self for agreement."

---

### Type 1: Physical Illness

**Verbatim**: "Physical illness is the one most prominent adaptive mechanism in people who get sick."

**Programming origin**: "The early life indoctrination or programming had to do with attention to body functioning."

**Verbatim**: "This would be an environment, say, in which the parents or the environment explained emotional disharmony by, with physical reasons. It's because you didn't get sleep. It's because of your stomach, whatever. Your bowels didn't move or that sort of thing."

**Core characteristic**: "These are people who focus on body."

### Physical Illness Manifestations

With reasonable flexibility: "might go back and forth with minor symptoms"

With increased anxiety → symptom development:
- Repeated physical illness
- Physical illness that doesn't heal rapidly
- Chronic illness "lighted up" at time of anxiety
- Illness triggered by anxiety

### Anxiety as Trigger (Detailed Examples)

**Chronic gallbladder example**:
**Verbatim**: "Somebody might have a chronic gallbladder that's been present for a long time, and with an increase in anxiety. The anxiety focuses on the organ system, and it can light up the symptom, light up the illness. In other words, it can take a chronic disease and make it into an acute one, into an acute surgical operation."

**Diabetes example**:
**Verbatim**: "It can take something like diabetes, which has been programmed into the organism for years, and suddenly in this anxiety field, it can become clinical diabetes."

**Cardiac problems**:
**Verbatim**: "We have pretty good evidence that it can trigger the development of cardiac problems. For instance, somebody who's been developing a heart problem for years in an anxiety field can suddenly have the closing off of the coronaries that can kill."

### Cancer Hypothesis

**Verbatim**: "Some of the thinking in recent years has gone to the sort of conviction that anxiety can play a part in triggering the development of a cancer even."

**Verbatim**: "The malignant cell has been dormant in the body since birth. Among the various triggers that can trigger this cell into activity, whether it be physiological or pathogenic or whatever, carcinogenic, I believe that anxiety is one of the triggers."

**Hurricane analogy**:
**Verbatim**: "I've used the analogy of the development of a hurricane that takes a number of different conditions to cause the hurricane to develop, and if any one of them is not present, the hurricane cannot develop. If you apply the same thinking to malignancy, it would say that it might be one of the necessary conditions for the development of a clinical cancer."

**Verbatim**: "Over the years, I have followed this in the families with which I have clinical contact, and I haven't found anything yet that would make me reverse this basic hypothesis."

### Undifferentiation Absorption

**Verbatim**: "Any of these various mechanisms, see if we assign an amount of undifferentiation, whatever amount we assign it, then distance between the spouses will contain a certain amount of this undifferentiation. Marital conflict can contain a large amount of it. Physical illness in a spouse can contain a tremendous amount of it."

**Verbatim**: "It is as if the anxiety, the undifferentiation is absorbed in this dysfunction."

---

### Type 2: Emotional Illness

**Question posed**: "What in the world has to do, what's the difference between the person who develops a physical illness from those that develop an emotional illness?"

**Programming difference**: "I believe environmental family attitudes about right and wrong, and a notion that sort of conveys to this one, you are the one who is the cause of the problem."

**Spectrum**: "Emotional dysfunction can be anything from mild depression to psychosis."

### Governing Variables for Emotional Illness

**Verbatim**: "If you can think of this third, this emotional illness, the variables that control it then is the degree of differentiation of self, the degree of anxiety, a family might go along fairly well with little emotional illness here and there, and then encounter big anxiety, and then big symptoms."

**Critical reminder**: "Let's not lose sight of the importance of anxiety in triggering this, and let us not lose sight of the relief of anxiety in the relief of it."

---

### What is Anxiety?

**Verbatim**: "What is anxiety? I would say anxiety is the emotional responsiveness of a person to situational stress. In other words, it's an emotional reactiveness in self."

### Chronic Anxiety Indicators

**Verbatim**: "When you get down into the average to poor levels of differentiation of self, the chronic anxiety is significant. The intensity of the anxiety can be judged by the intensity and fixedness of these symptoms, the relationship patterns."

**Pattern by differentiation level**:
- Well differentiated: "These patterns will be mild, they'll be there in periods of anxiety, and they'll go away"
- Lower levels: "These patterns are more intense"

**Verbatim**: "The intensity of these symptoms is determined by level of differentiation and principally anxiety."

---

### Type 3: Social Illness

**Definition**: "I've chosen that term to sort of indicate that it takes place more in the relationship system than in the individual."

**Diagnostic note**: "It's relatively easy to make a diagnosis as long as we have some definable dysfunction in an individual. In the social things, they're more in the relationship system."

### Programming for Social Illness

**Verbatim**: "The person who develops a social illness, then, is one whose thinking being focuses more in the relationship system than in self."

**Characteristic family message**: "I love you no matter what you do. Sort of indicating approval without much social or behavioral constraint."

### Focus Differences (Summary)

**Verbatim**: "The one that develops physical illness focuses on body or has had a body focus in life. The one who develops emotional illness has come from an environment that has focused on emotional things, attitudes, culture values. And the one who develops social illness has had a focus on behavior."

**Self-assessment**: "It is probably too simplistic, but it will sort of help to separate or know the difference between those."

### Social Illness Examples

**Verbatim**: "The social illnesses include drinking problems, drug problems, behavior problems, delinquency, and all kinds of failures to function in the family, in the work systems, and in social systems."

Specific examples:
- Inability to perform effectively
- Missing appointments
- "All kinds of things, forgetting"
- Drinking (emphasized as "important one")

### Gender Symmetry in Social Dysfunction

**Over-functioning wife concerned about husband**: "Doesn't keep a job, who is not responsible with the family money, irresponsibility in dress, irresponsibility in habits"

**Over-functioning husband concerned about wife**: "Sick wife, his dysfunctioned wife, who is too fatigued to carry through with her responsibilities in the home, in the family, in the social system with him in work"

**Verbatim**: "The number of husbands who are over-functioning, who are thinking about the wife and what goes on at home, they're involved with the kids, in addition to doing a good job in their own work. So the numbers of these on each side are about the same."

---

## Part D: The Over-Functioning / Under-Functioning Reciprocity

### Core Dynamic

**Verbatim**: "It is characteristic... for dysfunction to develop in only one spouse. The more one spouse under-functions, the more the other sort of over-functions or makes up for the dysfunction."

**Progression**: "As anxiety episodes go along, one spouse dysfunctions more and the other functions better. Until this one is so dysfunctional that they develop illness."

**Verbatim**: "This characteristically is a situation in which one is dysfunctional and the other is over-functional."

### Exceptions

**When over-functioner gets sick**: "It can stir up some interesting changes in the pattern"

**Weekend drinking pattern**: "The over-functioning husband is feeling over-burdened with all his responsibilities and he can become an evening and weekend drinker characteristically getting up and going back to work the next morning, staying on schedule but doing a lot of drinking as a manifestation of dysfunction in him."

---

## Part E: Family Projection Process (Detailed)

### Definition Restated

**Verbatim**: "This is one in which a major part of whatever degree of immaturity or undifferentiation up there is transmitted into one or more children."

### Female Fantasy System (Key to Prediction)

**Verbatim**: "This is easier to pick up in the fantasy system of the female than the male. After all, the female has the responsibility for reproduction and she is the one who does the most thinking about home, future, reproduction. This is so characteristic."

**Male contrast**: "Young boys who are simply not interested in this order of thing. They're thinking more of competing with the other boys, succeeding in athletic and all kinds of abilities. They don't think about this."

**Verbatim**: "So this is more a phenomenon that operates through the female."

### Fantasy Systems Predict Mechanisms

**Marital conflict prediction**: "In the post-adolescent period, the one that will develop marital conflict is one in which this one was thinking more about the man she was going to marry. Her thinking didn't go beyond that."

Cutoff intensifier: "Often the intensity of that is governed by the intensity of her urge to get away from the extended family."

**Family projection prediction**: "This can be picked up in the early fantasies of the female who is thinking about the number and the kind of children she will have."

**Verbatim**: "In its extreme form, it's almost as if marriage is incidental to her lifelong instinctual reproduction goals."

### The Basic Pattern for Projection

**Verbatim**: "We have the basic pattern for the family projection process, which is a husband who is cut off, a relationship which is distant."

**Verbatim**: "We all, society, we hear about the one parent family. It's usually the mother and the kids. We hear about the distant fathers. We have all the effort to bring the fathers back into it."

**Cultural note**: "Most of the people in our culture wouldn't disagree with that. Except here is a natural process in which emotional energy is directed here and much less of it here."

### Which Child?

**Verbatim**: "There's a number of things that govern which child."

Factors:
- Oldest son or oldest daughter
- Youngest son, youngest daughter
- Only child of either sex
- Child that looks like one of the parents
- Child conceived at time of great emotional turmoil

**Verbatim**: "The process characteristically fixes on one child. And then other children are less involved in it."

---

## Part F: The Mouse Scapegoating Research (John Calhoun)

### Basic Finding

**Verbatim**: "I like to compare this to some research work by Dr. John Calhoun in Bethesda with mice. If you can take a compound, a group of mice in an enclosure, in reasonable anxiety, these mice will scapegoat one mouse."

### Scapegoating Terminology

**Verbatim**: "I don't like the term scapegoating because it implies that the group does something bad to a victim. I've had some problems with the notion of projection. Projecting to somebody means you're doing something to them or can be interpreted, is that?"

**Preferred framing**: "Actually, I think of projection process as being there's too much anxiety in this system, and it sort of overflows to involve this one."

### The Multigenerational Mouse Experiment

**Verbatim**: "If you were to take the scapegoated one out of each colony and then, now this is the one who has been impaired, made sick by the colony in which it's lived, and then you put a group of these scapegoated mice together, then that group will scapegoat one mouse."

**Implication**: "The other mice who were dysfunctional and scapegoated, now in this new group, appear normal while they scapegoat one."

**Verbatim**: "As far as I'm concerned, you can keep on repeating this process and taking the scapegoated ones out of several colonies and putting them together, and they'll scapegoat one, take these scapegoated ones, put them together, and that'll scapegoat another."

### Human Parallel

**Verbatim**: "You have to think in terms of parents back up here as having been scapegoated somewhere in their past, which has to do with them looking more normal than they are."

---

## Part G: Flexibility vs. Fixedness

### The Mixture Principle

**Verbatim**: "Most of us, with an average level of differentiation, will use a mixture of these mechanisms. We'll all use emotional distance to a degree. We'll all use a little marital conflict. We'll all have some dysfunction in a spouse. And we'll all have some family projection process."

**Therapeutic implication**: "When this occurs, this is a more flexible family. When all of these mechanisms, patterns are in a marriage, it is a less intense problem. It's easier to reverse in psychotherapy. It's more flexible."

### Pure Cases for Study

**Verbatim**: "There are a few families that will use one mechanism almost entirely."

**Research value**: "Most of us, these things are all so mixed up, we can't separate one from the other. But when we can find one with marital conflict almost exclusively, those are the ones that I like to investigate for this."

Examples of pure cases:
- Marital conflict only: "Both spouses are healthy, and in which very little is projected to the kids"
- Physical illness only: "The marriage is harmonious, the kids are all doing well, and all we have is a sick spouse"
- Emotional or social illness only

**Verbatim**: "These are the ones that I think are the best examples for study, because they give a little clearer distinction."

### Patterns as Fixed as Fingerprints

**Verbatim**: "There are these definite patterns which are as fixed in families as any characteristics in families. I'd say they're almost as defined as a fingerprint, the way the relationship patterns and the way they're used."

---

## Part H: Marital Conflict Does NOT Cause Problems in Kids

### Common Misconception

**Verbatim**: "We have all these things in which we say that marital conflict causes problems in kids. Don't believe it."

**Clarification**: "Marital conflict is part of it when the spouses are using all four of these mechanisms. Then it's part of it."

**Key distinction**: "There are these families in which is just about, marital conflict is about the only pattern and in which the kids are relatively free."

### What Does Get to Kids

**Verbatim**: "Any of these mechanisms that operate up here do not get to the kids. The ones that get to the kids is either a combination of all of these and the kid or this one that applies mostly to schizophrenia."

**Critical mechanism**: "That is family projection process."

---

## Part I: The Quantum Jump to Schizophrenia

### Most Intense Version

**Verbatim**: "The most intense version of that that I've ever seen is in autism and severe schizophrenia in which the parents can have a close, harmonious relationship. Both spouses can be healthy, no conflict, in which the only problem is the kid. And that's the family in which it takes a quantum jump."

### Pattern Description

**Verbatim**: "In schizophrenia, this is the main mechanism. It is a mother who is focused on this, who's a father who is far away, and she's caught up in this cocoon with the kids, mostly the cocoon with this one."

### Equal Impairment Across Types

**Verbatim**: "I believe that there can be, that the level of differentiation can be as impaired in any of these as in this one. The endpoint of this one is schizophrenia. But people with physical illness can die of physical illness. Emotional illness, they can die. A social illness, they can be made dysfunctional."

**Verbatim**: "I would say the basic level of differentiation, undifferentiation can be the same in all of these."

### Unfortunate Terminology

**Verbatim**: "I think the term schizophrenia is an unfortunate term. Schizophrenia defines the endpoint of the development of emotional symptoms."

---

## Part J: Variable 3 — Contact with Past Generations

### Protective Function

**Verbatim**: "The more these spouses can keep open relationships to their families of origin, the less intense this whole thing."

**Natural correlation**: "It is a fact that better differentiated people automatically keep more open relationships."

### Paradox of Apparent Normalcy

**Verbatim**: "There's a spectrum of people whose functioning is reasonably, basic differentiation is reasonably low, but who are able to keep open relationships with the past and they appear normal."

### Critical Distinction

**Verbatim**: "One of the biggest problems in people thinking about the concept of differentiation is that they consider distance to be differentiation or they can consider emotional fusion to be emotional closeness. So it's often misinterpreted."

### Generational Pause

**Verbatim**: "With people who can keep contact with the past, all of these mechanisms might be so reduced that nobody is seriously impaired and this might continue for a generation into the future."

---

## Part K: The Three-Generation Hypothesis Refined

### Original Claim

**Verbatim**: "I used to think in terms of three generations of quantum jumps to produce schizophrenia."

### Refinement

**Verbatim**: "There's no such thing as having three successive generations in which this pattern is the pattern and in which there is an ideal child to be the recipient of it when the child happens to come along at the right time."

**Frequency**: "The frequency of that is very low in which you could have this repeating three successive generations."

**Verbatim**: "I believe that we could go from a reasonable level of differentiation here to a low level of differentiation here in three generations if all things were optimum for this transmission process."

**Reality**: "But most of the time this is not so. Most of the time this process can be slowed down."

### Accelerating Factors

**Mother's emotional responsiveness to sex of child**: "She has some kind of a emotional responsiveness or turned on-ness to girls and not to boys or the opposite. And when this occurs, then the process can go much faster."

**Right child at right time**: "The child that comes at the right time, right sex"

### Intensification Across Generations

**Verbatim**: "What happens as society goes through the generations is there's more and more of this in successive generations, is that the intensity of the problem up here is greater in the next generation."

**Mouse parallel**: "You put three scapegoated ones together, and two of those will look normal, and one is more scapegoated, and put the more scapegoated together, and put three of those together, and two look normal, and one looks scapegoated."

---

## Part L: Therapeutic Variables

### Opening the System

**Verbatim**: "Therapeutically, whatever we can do to open this up will reduce the intensity of the anxiety in this, plus the various ways we use, try to train people to deal better with anxiety."

### Conventional Anxiety Reduction

**Verbatim**: "There's a conventional one in the mental health professions that people often use for reducing anxiety, which is relationships in the social system."

Methods that reduce anxiety intensity:
- Individual therapy
- Group therapy ("provides something in reducing the intensity of this. It tones it down")
- Religious movements
- Charismatic movements

### Critical Limitation

**Verbatim**: "That does not increase the level of differentiation nor slow down the evolution of this across multiple generations."

---

## Closing Summary

**Verbatim**: "This then is my working notion of how symptoms evolve in the nuclear family."

**Four integrated elements**:
1. Basic level of differentiation of self
2. Kind of programming from families of origin
3. Way spouses combine programming with mix of patterns
4. Anxiety as trigger

**Verbatim**: "I would like to leave open the possibility of an unusually fortunate marriage in a generation, which can slow down this process for a generation or two."

**Verbatim**: "It has to do with the evolution and development of all symptoms from the mildest to the most severe."

### Systems Thinking Advantage

**Verbatim**: "I think this is one of the advantages of systems thinking. It puts in a number of variables for understanding it. And most important of all, it puts in the same number of variables for dealing with it in therapy."
