# Bowen Basic Series

Exhaustive captures of Murray Bowen's video lecture series, seminal training material for clinicians in Bowen Family Systems Theory.

## Why This Matters

These lectures represent Bowen teaching directly — his explanations, clinical examples, and theoretical formulations in his own words. The captures preserve:

1. **Verbatim concepts** where Bowen's language is conceptually rich
2. **Clinical examples** that illustrate theoretical constructs in practice
3. **Theoretical precision** — operational distinctions often lost in secondary sources
4. **Source material** for the Implicit Behavioral Model Synthesis

## Key Concepts by Part

### Part 1: Triangles and Scale
- Triangle as the molecule of any emotional system
- Scale of differentiation (0-100)
- Functional vs. basic self
- Calm vs. tension positions in triangles

### Part 2: Nuclear Family and Projection
- Three anxiety-binding mechanisms (conflict, spouse dysfunction, projection to child)
- Solid vs. pseudo self
- Family projection process sequence

### Part 3: Multigenerational Transmission
- Minimum 3 generations to schizophrenia
- Sibling position (Toman research)
- Dates reveal connections — symptom timing

### Part 4: Differentiation / I Position
- "A self is never defined in words. It's defined only when you can take an action stand"
- Three predictable countermoves: "You're wrong" → "Change back" → "Consequences"
- Differentiation ≠ Distance

### Part 5: Symptom Development
- Four governing variables: differentiation, relationship patterns, contact with past generations, anxiety
- Three dysfunction types: physical, emotional, social illness
- Over/under-functioning reciprocity

### Part 6: Family Reaction to Death
- Death as chief taboo
- Open vs. closed relationship systems
- Emotional shockwave phenomenon

### Part 7: Emotional Cutoff (Clinical Example)
- Interview with Kathleen Yanks demonstrating cutoff patterns
- "The resistance within me is great... I built the cutoff"
- Cutoff predicts next generation cutoff
