## Overview

This lecture addresses death as the chief taboo subject in human life, introduces the open/closed relationship system concept, and presents the "emotional shockwave" phenomenon — a distinct clinical entity in which deaths trigger cascading symptoms throughout extended family systems. Includes detailed clinical examples and practical guidance for physicians.

---

## Part A: Man's Relationship to Death

### Opening Thesis

**Verbatim**: "Man is the only living being that knows from earliest life with his logical thinking system that his life will end in death. I don't believe that there's any one subject that occupies more of man's direct or indirect thinking time than death."

### Death Theme Manifestations

**Religion**: "All have death and immortality as a common theme, but each deals with details in a different way."

Examples of religious frameworks:
- "Death is not death, but an entry into the permanent ideal existence in heaven"
- "Life is a preparation for the better life in heaven"
- Good → good afterlife; bad → bad afterlife
- Reincarnation: good life → higher form; bad life → lower form

**Verbatim**: "Man has also devised complicated rituals designed to appease the gods that he be granted a longer life."

### Constant Reminders Throughout Life

- Mothers protective of young → "reminder that the child is very important to the parents and that one's life or death is dependent on others"
- Good health practices → "reminders that if they care if they're carried out life will be longer"
- Safety precautions → "lest we meet accidental death"
- Life insurance → "protecting one's loved ones"
- Philosophies: "better to die with one's boots on... death to come suddenly without the long painful process of contemplating death"

### The Paradox

**Verbatim**: "The thesis here is that man is reminded of death moment by moment his entire life while at the very same time he has elaborate ways to deny death and his own mortality."

---

## Part B: Open and Closed Relationship Systems

### Definition of Open System

**Verbatim**: "An open system would be one in which the relationship at least with one other important person is open, meaning that one can communicate pretty much of what one thinks and feels and one's fantasies about self to the other person and the other person can communicate such back."

### Advantage of Open Systems

**Verbatim**: "If a person can have an open relationship with the important people in his life, especially one important other, there's indication that this is a more healthy way of life."

**Verbatim**: "In terms of the maturity, immaturity, or in terms of the concepts that are used about a better functioning person or a better integrated person, I'd say that one with an open system is the better integrated one."

### Courtship as Best Example

**Verbatim**: "Probably the best open system, I think, in adult life for most people is a courtship. This is one in which the two people are less dependent on each other and they're free to communicate freely back and forth to each other."

### The Closing Process in Marriage

**Verbatim**: "Almost by the time then people are married, the relationship system begins to get more restricted. During courtship they were not as emotionally dependent on each other. After marriage they become more attuned to the needs of each other and areas become off-limits."

**Process**:
1. "Very soon they become aware of the subjects that will make the other anxious"
2. "Neither wants to upset the other"
3. "Slowly they begin to know that taboo subjects that are not to be mentioned"
4. "So the average marriage has its list of taboo subjects that neither mentions to the other lest it upset the other, and if the other's upset then self is upset"

**Verbatim**: "So begins the communication cutoff between spouses."

### The Emotional Reflex

**Verbatim**: "This responsiveness to the other's anxiety is like an emotional reflex."

**If only people could know**: "The purposeful mention of the taboo subject. If one can control one's own anxious response to the other, can desensitize the whole mechanism, it would be a healthier world."

**Reality**: "But people are human and the emotional reflex is as automatic as any reflex. By the time they seek help for a problem, that is in family psychotherapy, it has gone beyond their own ability to change the mechanism or to repair the cutoff."

### Family Therapy Magic

**Verbatim**: "This is the magic of family therapy. Either spouse can talk to a third person without the emotional response operating, and through this modality they can come to know the other's thoughts, feelings, and fantasies without the intense emotional reaction."

### Death as Chief Taboo

**Verbatim**: "Chief among all taboo subjects in a person's life is death."

**Therapeutic opportunity**: "A third person who has control of his own anxiety can help open up a closed relationship system with magical results in the relationship."

---

## Part C: Two Types of Reaction to Death

### General Principle

**Verbatim**: "For most families, the family adaptation to death is far greater, is far more difficult, takes longer than the adaptation of the one who dies."

### Type 1: Immediate Emotional Reaction

**Verbatim**: "As a general thing, the more open the communication system, the more intense the emotional reaction immediately after death, but the more quickly the grief is resolved."

### Type 2: Deep Underlying Reaction

**Verbatim**: "There's another area of reactions which is a deep underlying reaction that can go for months or for years. It's greatest when there's little emotional expression at the time of death. It can be present when the loss is great, even when the system is fairly open."

**Key distinction**: "I'd like to make a clear distinction about the emotional reaction immediately after death and the long term underlying one."

---

## Part D: Nuclear and Extended Family Systems

### Definitions

**Nuclear family**: "Father, mother and children. It can be the household."

**Function**: "The nuclear family attempts to get the system in emotional equilibrium so people are comfortable."

### Extended Family Connections

**Verbatim**: "The father in this family is also a part of his family of origin, his extended family system. And his functioning in the nuclear family is dependent on the emotional equilibrium in the extended family system."

Same for wife: "Her functioning in the nuclear family can depend on the emotional harmony in her family system."

**Verbatim**: "The emotional harmony in the nuclear family can depend on the husband's extended system."

---

## Part E: Family System Disturbances

### Core Principle

**Verbatim**: "In broad terms, a family system is disturbed, that's nuclear family or the extended family, by the addition to or the loss of a family member, the family constellation."

### Additions That Disturb

1. **First child**: "Changes a husband-wife, two-person relationship into a three-person relationship. And the characteristic ways of relating is different."
   - Example: "A husband might get upset and start drinking and drink for a period until the system realigns itself"

2. **Second child**: "Changes from a three-person system to a four-person system"

3. **Return of long-lost family member**: "Probably the most intense"
   - Example: "The family member who's been a long time in an institution. The family has found a new way of adapting without this family member, and then the family member returns to it."

### Losses That Disturb

Mild losses:
- Child goes to school — "outside the family and into a new way of life"
- Child goes to college
- Children marry

**Verbatim**: "Family reaction to loss is generally greater than adding family members."

### Most Intense Disturbance

**Verbatim**: "I think the greatest disturbance in family equilibrium is the death or threatened death of a family member. Threatened death can disturb a family just as much as an actual death."

---

## Part F: The Emotional Shockwave Phenomenon

### Discovery

**Verbatim**: "I'd like to present some ideas about the kinds of family constellations in which each of these might occur. To do this, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the emotional shockwave phenomenon, which I encountered very early in family research. It hasn't been well written up, but it is a distinct entity."

### Clinical Example (Detailed)

**Index case**: Mother in late 50s, died suddenly of stroke, about 10 children mostly married in same state.

**Events within 18 months of death**:
1. Oldest grandchild (dental school) — car wreck en route to funeral, knocked out front teeth
2. Father — drank heavily for 18 months, then discovered diabetes
3. Single son (living at home) — lost job, began drinking, first trouble with police
4. Daughter 1,000 miles away — "had no visual reaction to the time to the mother's death. But within six months, one of her daughters began serious behavior problems, and her other daughter was seriously injured in a bicycle accident"
5. Son-in-law — heart attack
6. Another daughter — gallbladder operation with serious surgical complications

### Initial Reaction

**Verbatim**: "My initial reaction to this shockwave phenomenon was to regard it as a coincidence. But on further investigation, this occurs so frequently that now I do a survey of the family field to check for this phenomenon in every family I see."

### Family Obliteration of Connectedness

**Verbatim**: "It is so routine for family member to obliterate any connectedness between this death or this traumatic event and the events that follow that the history about it is confused and obliterated."

**Verbatim**: "I wouldn't be willing to say that this death causes this, but I would be willing to say that these kinds of human problems follow a death in time sequence in a fair percentage of families."

### Another Example: Shoplifting and Breast Tumor

Grandson arrested for shoplifting on the day grandmother hospitalized for benign breast tumor removal.

**Verbatim**: "The family anxiety of course had treated it as if this was a cancer and the boy's reaction would be based on the family perception of it."

**History taking difficulty**: "The family members were so focused on the behavior problem in the boy... and it was so difficult to finally even hear about this operation which occurred simultaneously with the shoplifting."

### Therapeutic Timing

**Verbatim**: "The family tendency to obliterate connectedness is so great I never tell them about it until well in family psychotherapy. People seem to be threatened by the implication that the functioning itself is dependent on what goes on in another family member."

### Rare Awareness

**Verbatim**: "In some 3,000 detailed family histories I found only one in which a family member indicated some awareness of the connectedness."

**That case**: Father said, "My family was doing well until a year ago last May, about 18 months before, when my daughter was married."

Events in 18 months after daughter's marriage:
- Wife: gallbladder removed, spinal fusion, hospitalized for depression, moved four times (unhappy with houses)
- Husband: heart attack
- Son: flunked out of college

**Bowen's interpretation**: "The family or the functioning of the family was very dependent on the presence of this daughter. And when she moved out there was some kind of disruption that was manifested in this way."

### Threatened Death = Actual Death

**Verbatim**: "Threatened death can stir as much reaction as actual death. The family reaction is dependent more on the escalating family anxiety than on reality."

**Example**: "An intense shock wave in a large extended family that began when the mother had a radical mastectomy for cancer. The shock wave was still going on five years later when the mother was pronounced cured."

---

## Part G: Predicting Family Reactiveness

### The Key Variable

**Verbatim**: "I believe the most important cue that has to do with family reactiveness has to do with the functioning position in the family of the one who dies."

**Verbatim**: "Potential reactiveness is greatest when that person goes from full functioning to death in a brief period."

### High Reactiveness Deaths

1. **Father or mother in vigor of life**: "Such a death can remove the father and breadwinner or it can remove the mother when she is most needed by our children."

2. **Head of the clan**: "Every family has a functional head of the clan who becomes the responsible doer when there's a job to be done in the family."

**Verbatim**: "Some families deny they have such a person, but when there's a problem, one person will step forward to take the responsibility."

**Example**: "If the wife was the sort of matriarch who was responsible and respected in a family, then the shockwave would come more in relation to her than to her husband."

**Verbatim**: "In many families, this head of the clan is sort of nominated by the family and the responsibility accepted by the person. That's what it takes to be the head of a clan."

**Spiritual head beyond physical capacity**: "I've seen some families in which this person maintains a position as kind of a spiritual head of the family long after physical health is declined."
- Example: Grandmother, physical invalid many years, "still counseled and advised the entire family that came to her room where she was sick"

3. **Important child**: "The death or a life-threatening illness or a disabling injury in an important child"
- "Most frequent in a child that is endowed with emotional importance in the family, such as an only child, an only son, an only daughter, or a gifted child"

### Neutral Reactions

**Verbatim**: "Among the more neutral reactions to death can be the family member who has been neither famous nor infamous in the family system."

"People who haven't made great contributions to the family nor have they been a great problem to the family. Often when these die, the reaction is more a transient emotional reaction without the long-term shaking reaction."

### Deaths That Relieve

**Verbatim**: "In general terms, death that relieves is the death of a person who has not contributed to family functioning and who, in addition, has become a burden to the family."

"These are the people who have been sick for a very long time, been a burden, and the family can reach a point of hoping that they would die, and the person themselves can hope for death."

---

## Part H: Opening Closed Systems Around Death

### Primary Therapeutic Goal

**Verbatim**: "If there's anything that one can do toward alleviating this, it's to work toward creating an open communication system in the family."

**Verbatim**: "The physician who can help open the system can be of great help to the family."

### Physician as Bridge

**Verbatim**: "It can be difficult to open a communication system between, say, a husband and a wife, but the more the physician can open the communication system between himself and the patient, the more it will help the patient and the other spouse or other family members open the system."

### Clinical Example: Scientist with Malignancy

Husband — bright scientist, extremely interested in lab procedures "until the moment they made a diagnosis of malignancy. Nobody ever told him it was malignant, but his question stopped."

**Physician avoidance**: Wife asked who would tell husband about cancer.
- Urologist: "I can't tell him. I'll refer him to the general practitioner."
- General practitioner: "Spent about 55 minutes sort of alluding to the problem without mentioning it, and then did mention it toward the end of the hour."
- Result: "The husband didn't react to it, and he didn't mention it after that."

### The Mutual Cutoff Pattern

**Verbatim**: "Then there are the hundreds of patients who are believed not to know about malignancy. And this is the situation in which the family knows, and they believe the patient doesn't know. And the patient deep inside of them know, but they don't want to tell the family."

**Bowen's own family example**: "I made a special trip to talk to the one who had the malignancy. And she was able to talk about it quite frankly to me and to say, sure, she knew she had a cancer and she was going to die, but don't tell the rest of the family. And the family knew she had a cancer, but they were saying, don't tell her."

### Suicidal Patients as Teachers

**Verbatim**: "In my early years in psychiatry, I wasn't especially interested in death. One of the things that helped me get me interested was talking to suicidal patients who are quite willing and glad to talk about death in great detail. All you have to do is ask them and they'll go at length."

**Generalized finding**: "Routinely I found when I asked about their thoughts of death, they were willing to talk at length. And then to say thank you for asking and listening."

---

## Part I: The Technique of Direct Language

### Core Principle

**Verbatim**: "In talking about these taboo subjects, I found the factual use of simple words is far better than words that allude to the situation or that beat around the bush, hoping that the other will get the point and be direct."

### Clinical Example: The Affair

Wife seeking help with affair of months duration. Second interview, husband came — interviewer hoped husband would mention affair, but he didn't. Third interview: demonstration before audience.

**Verbatim**: "Here was a situation in which every person in the room knew about the affair, quotes, except the husband."

Bowen's first question to wife: "Why she had not told her husband about the affair."

**Wife's immediate response**: "I've been trying to tell him for six months, but he won't listen."

**Husband's immediate response**: "I've been suspecting it for six months, and I think I know who the man is."

**Result**: "From that opening exchange, the relationship system was open, and we were able to go immediately into more significant problems."

### Criticism and Response

**Verbatim**: "I have reported this example to a number of professional groups, and a fair percentage of people will say this is mean or cruel, or that someday I'll get hit by asking such questions."

**Bowen's view**: "I believe the factual, open presentation of the subject, presented in a way that's free of guilt, not biased, and offered in a way to be helpful, can communicate to the other person that I am comfortable with the subject, and make it possible for them to talk frankly."

### Specific Word Choices

**Verbatim**: "In talking about death, I carefully use the words death, die, bury, and all the other simple words that have to do with death. I avoid terms such as passed on, deceased, expired, and other such less direct words."

**Consequence of indirect language**: "When I introduce the subject with tangential words, the other will respond with tangential words, and soon the conversation is alluding to death to the point that one can be wondering if we're really talking about death."

**Why it works**: "I believe it works because I'm comfortable with it, and it conveys to the other that I'm comfortable and then they're comfortable responding."

---

## Part J: Clinical Case — The Cancer Mother (Detailed)

### Setup

Visiting professor, had talked 9am-3pm. At 3pm, announced family interview. Father and mother in 40s, seen weekly for 18 months about teenage daughter hospitalized.

**The secret**: "The mother had a cancer that her surgeon had told the father. The father had told the psychotherapist, and the mother didn't know about it."

### Bowen's Dilemma

"Here I was in possession of information about this woman, and it would be difficult not a character for me to not deal with this issue, but I wondered if I dare touch it since I would be leaving so soon after the interview and would not be available for any follow-up interviews if they were needed."

### The Intervention

About ten minutes in, asked mother: "Why she thought her surgeon and the family and others had not told her about her cancer."

**Mother's response (without hesitation)**: "I think they're afraid. I know I have a cancer. I've known it some time. Before that, I feared it, and when they told me it was not cancer, at first I believed them and that it was not my imagination. Now I know it's a cancer, and when I ask them and they say no, what does it mean? It either means they are liars or I'm crazy, and I know I'm not crazy."

### Mother's Detailed Feelings

**On death**: "I'm not afraid to die. My main reason for wanting to live would be to see my sick daughter recover enough to have a life for herself. I hate the thoughts of leaving her the responsibility of my husband. But for me, I'm not afraid."

**On isolation** (Verbatim): "This is the loneliest life in the world. Here I am knowing I'm going to die, and not knowing how much more time I have, and I can't talk to anyone about it. When I try to talk to my surgeon, he says I do not have a cancer. When I try to talk to my husband, he makes jokes about it. My session's here to talk about my daughter, and not me. I'm cut off from everyone."

**Daily experience**: "Each morning I feel terrible. The first thing I do is look at my eyes in the mirror to see if I have metastases of the liver. Then I try to act cheerful until my husband goes to work because I don't want to upset him. Then I'm alone with my thoughts all day, just crying and thinking. Then I try to pull myself together before my husband comes home. I don't know how much longer I can stand this pretending. I wish I could die soon and not have to pretend anymore. But I don't want to upset my husband and daughter."

**Childhood memory**: "As a little girl, she used to feel hurt to see people walk on other people's graves. From that time, she had wished that when she died she could be buried in a mausoleum so people couldn't walk on her grave. But, she said, we're poor people, we could never afford a mausoleum, and I know when I die I'll be buried in another grave like the rest."

### Room Dynamics

"She and I were the calmest people in the room. She spoke with deep feeling but few tears."

- Therapist: "Moved to tears"
- Husband: "Became joking and kidding, making jokes about her vivid imagination"

**Intervention with husband**: "A few comments to him about interrupting his wife's serious thoughts about death was enough to get him to settle down and to enable her to keep talking."

### Finding an Ally

**Regular therapist**: "Said she had known about the malignancy, but she had been waiting on the wife to bring up the subject."

### Ending

**Wife's closing**: "Smiling through some tears, we've sure spent an hour walking around on my grave, haven't we?"

**In the hall**: "When you go back home tonight, please thank Washington for sending you here today."

**Husband**: "We're both grateful."

### Audience Reaction

"About a fourth of them had been moved to tears during the session. A majority were silent and impressed. There was one young physician who spoke up about hurting the mother and taking away her hope."

### Bowen's Reflection

**Verbatim**: "I was thinking of Harry Truman's phrase about if it's too hot in the kitchen. And I was thinking, if a psychotherapist can't stand the heat, he shouldn't be in the kitchen."

**Prediction about audience**: "Those who cried during the interview would probably find it easier to become comfortable with death than the one whose emotion went into an intellectual thesis about hurting and taking away hope."

---

## Part K: Every Ego Can Handle Death Discussion

### The Myth of "Weak Egos"

**Verbatim**: "In psychiatry, we used to have discussions about whether or not this person's ego was strong enough for a death discussion."

**Bowen's experience**: "My experience over the years has led to the conviction that every ego is strengthened by an opportunity to talk to someone who can stay factual and unemotional and unbiased about death."

**Where the problem lies**: "It might hurt an ego if the physician can't do this. I believe the problem rests more with the physician and the family and not the patient."

### Even Coma Patients

**Verbatim**: "I've even talked with people mentally confused after strokes or terminal brain cancer, brain tumor patients, who appear to be too far into a coma to talk, only to find them eager to pull themselves out of the coma long enough to talk lucidly about death, and often their wish for death, and then to say thank you before drifting back into the coma."

### Family Transmission of Anxiety

**Verbatim**: "This was all before I went into family research and became aware of the intense responsiveness of family members to the anxiety and discomfort in other family members, all of which is transmitted in a tone of voice, a look, a gesture, a pause in speaking, or something they say, or by any number of subtle cues."

---

## Part L: Personal Example — Neighbor's Wife Death (Detailed)

### Setup

Young couple in 30s, three children. Husband scheduled to go overseas; wife and children staying with her mother. Met them Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Saturday after Thanksgiving — wife dropped dead suddenly of heart attack.

### The Three-Hour Session (Day of Death)

**Verbatim**: "That evening, I spent about three hours with the husband."

**His questions**:
- How to handle death with children
- Should they go to school tomorrow or stay home?
- What to tell teachers, neighbors
- How to explain to children
- Getting married again — "My children have to have a mother but how can I be talking like this only eight hours after my wife's dead"

**His emotional pattern**: "During that three hours he cried frequently. He'd touch any kind of a sensitive subject he would cry."

**Children's response to his tears**: "Please don't cry daddy"

### Bowen's Guidance

**Verbatim**: "My thesis in this is the children are amazingly capable of dealing with death if they're confronted with the facts on terms they can understand."

**Warning**: "Don't start this unless you're prepared to deal with the adverse reactions of neighbors and others who have contact with it."

**Specific suggestions**:
1. When crying, say to children he's okay, don't worry about him
2. Children will stop talking about death soon — father should bring it up with reminders
3. Let children decide about school
4. **Key suggestion**: Before funeral, take children to funeral home, have everyone else leave, private session with father, children, and dead mother

**Verbatim**: "I thought if they could relate directly to this situation it would help a lot with reality."

**Rare achievement**: "This I believe is the only man I've ever seen who's been able to carry a suggestion like that through all the way. Others fault or somewhere but he walked all the way."

### Tuesday Evening (Two Days After)

"I spent an hour or so with him. The children in the bedroom, the children sitting in his lap. He could cry, they could cry, and they were asking questions."

**Five-year-old Stevie asked**: "Could he kiss mommy?"

**Bowen's response**: "Well in that between stevie and his mother."

### Managing Extended Family Anxiety

**Verbatim**: "I thought that these people would get anxious about him taking these children to the funeral home, and if I stated rather authoritatively what's to take place that it would help him carry out the plan."

**Announcement to living room**: "On Wednesday the father would take the children to the funeral home and nobody was to be present in that room except the father and the children with the dead mother."

**Husband's mother (anxiously)**: "Son that would be too hard for you."

**Husband's response**: "Mother shut up I can do it."

### Wednesday at Funeral Home

**What happened**:
- Children went up to casket, looked, felt their mother
- Stevie: "If I kissed her she couldn't kiss back"
- Children went "all around the casket under it inspecting everything"
- Youngest boy got under casket, "praying that his mother could hold him in her arms again in heaven"
- During visit, friends came in — children went to lobby, found pebbles in planter
- One child put pebble in mother's hand, then other two did same
- Children said: "We can go now daddy"

**Result**: "Within a week these children were talking about their mother in the past tense. Which I think is quite an accomplishment."

### Long-Term Follow-Up

- Husband remarried following year
- Did not go to Asia, went to Mediterranean instead (closer if needed)
- Children stayed with grandmother that year, then went with father after remarriage
- "As far as I can tell this is as ideal a family adjustment as one could have"

## Part M: The Father's Written Account

### His Document: "My God My Wife Is Dead"

Written four years after wife's death. Key excerpts:

**Critical moment**: "At that critical moment not 15 minutes after my wife's death i found myself looking up to god and praying for guidance to have the wisdom to see and do the correct things. This in itself upon reflection was a surprising reaction to me since i had never considered myself to be a deeply religious man."

**His viewpoint**: "I'm an engineer and i have the viewpoint that a problem must be faced directly and realistically to arrive at the best solution. The solution was tough to execute but i realized the week before the burial was one of the most critical in the children's lives. Their entire outlook on life and the psychological well-being could depend on how it was handled."

**His advice to parents who lose a spouse**:
1. "Face death squarely and remove possible fantasy dreams of the living return of the loved one"
2. "Stop worrying about yourself and turn your thoughts and concerns outward to those around you"
3. "Think of the past as a fond memory and remember the future on earth is for the living"
4. "Place your faith and future in the hands of god"

### Bowen's Assessment

**Verbatim**: "This husband had far more strength than any other husband i've ever seen in such a situation."
