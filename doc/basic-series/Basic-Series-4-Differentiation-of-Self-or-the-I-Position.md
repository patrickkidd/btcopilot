## Overview

This lecture combines theory and therapy — "How do you use the theory in therapy?"

Focus:
- **Undifferentiated family ego mass** — how individual is emotionally involved in family
- **Differentiation of self** — "theoretical and practical ways that one can define a self or be a self in this emotional system"

---

## Part A: Understanding the Undifferentiated Family Ego Mass

### Emotional Forces Toward "We"

**Verbatim**: "If you take it on a simple two person system, you put two people together and the emotional forces go toward we, one of us, defining the oneness of the system. And the more one defines the oneness of a system, the more the individuality is defocused."

### Experiential Example: The Work System

Bowen's personal observation from a clinic:

**Verbatim**: "I would have the experience of going away from the clinic and being much more objective about people and what went on. And this objectivity would last as long as I was away. And then return back, the objectivity would often last until I had returned to work, not returned to town, but returned to work."

- Almost at the moment of driving into parking lot or entering building: "I would find this emotional system closing in"
- "I would become more a part of it and less separated or differentiated from it"

**Same applies to family visits**: "As soon as they arrive home, they find they get back into the same emotional position they had when they were living in the family."

### Diagrammatic Representation

**Fusion diagram**:
- Husband fused into wife, wife fused into husband
- Children fused into system
- Each has degree of fusion back with families of origin
- Wife fused with her mother, father
- Husband fused with his mother, father
- Plus many other people

**Verbatim**: "If you diagram it in this way, it gives you a kind of a picture of the emotional fusion that holds people together. That's this emotional oneness."

### Goal of Family Psychotherapy

**Verbatim**: "My system of family psychotherapy would be to help an individual be more of a self and be less dependent on this mass, to be more separated from it."

### Critical Distinction: Differentiation vs. Distance

**Verbatim**: "This is not to be confused with the people who tear themselves away from it."

Example: Someone who is "so miserably uncomfortable" that they go away and get distance.

**Verbatim**: "Well, these people are not really out of it. Instead of being up in it, they're still hooked on to it. They're just geographically away."

Common claim: "They have handled things with the family and they're out of it"

**Bowen's response**: "That's distancing or going away from it."

**Consequence**: "As soon as the person is just separated from the family, then they are real vulnerable... to getting involved in another relationship, which is a replica of this."

- Out alone and separated
- Emotional ties still there
- Get into new emotional system
- "Over a long run, it's going to end up with the same kind of thing that was up there"

---

## Part B: The Role of the Therapist/Coach

### Therapist as Potential Triangle Vertex

**Verbatim**: "One of the most important principles in this whole system of psychotherapy is the therapist."

Bowen's terminology shift:

**Verbatim**: "Over the years, I've tended more to call myself a coach or a supervisor because as soon as a therapist takes a therapeutic position to this, then he is vulnerable to becoming a part of it."

### Staying Outside the System

**Verbatim**: "This requires the therapist to keep an outside... to keep outside of this and not to become involved in it."

**Misperception addressed**:

**Verbatim**: "As I've talked about the therapist becoming or staying out of the emotional system, people often say or refer to this as being cold and indifferent. Well, this is a misperception of it. The person who perceives this as being cold and indifferent is usually a person who is quite involved in it himself. And from his position of over-involvement, he would see this as distant and non-feeling."

**Reality**:

**Verbatim**: "I don't think a person in this position ever stays out. I think he merely makes some kind of a consistent effort to know when he gets involved in it and to be able to do something about it."

### When Therapist Stays Out: Chain Reaction

If therapist can stay outside:
1. One person (e.g., husband) becomes more sure of self, clearer self
2. "The intensity of this is less"
3. Wife picks it up — "a little bit more of a self over there and less dependent on him"
4. Children begin to pick it up
5. "Once the process starts, then it can go through the whole family"

**Ripple effect to extended family**: Husband was in equilibrium with family of origin at old level. When he becomes more of self in marriage → "that disturbs this" → problems of differentiating from extended family too.

**Also ripples to social/work systems**: "When any person changes in a system, the system changes."

---

## Part C: The Three Predictable Steps of Differentiation

### The Pattern

**Verbatim**: "There are three main steps that are absolutely predictable when a person differentiates to a higher level of self."

When one changes → upsets equilibrium of other → three-step response:

1. **"You are wrong"** — "You're hurting me, this is a terrible thing you're doing" — pointing out negative
2. **"Change back"**
3. **"If you don't, these are the consequences"**

**Verbatim**: "So anytime anybody makes a significant step toward differentiating a self, the rest of the emotional system attacks in these three steps."

**Verbatim**: "This is my notion of why it is so difficult for a person to differentiate from another person. It upsets the other and it upsets self to have the other upset."

### Clinical Example: Interfaith Marriage

Young Episcopal woman engaged to Jewish man. Both families welcomed them on surface.

**Letter from older sister (family spokesman)** after visit:
1. "You're wrong" — "even to the point of saying this is morally wrong, and a page or two to support that"
2. "Change back" — "Give him up. You'll never notice it in the future. You'll be over it in a short time."
3. "If you don't" — "I'm not going to have anything to do with you in the future, and your brothers will not be your brothers anymore"

### Bowen's Response to "Pathological" Label

**Verbatim**: "Now, on the surface, you could say, well, this is a real pathological situation. And this is something about which I have some real strong convictions. Psychiatry has too long referred to such things as pathological. And this is not pathological. This is characteristic of us all, of all emotional systems."

**Verbatim**: "To call it pathological is one of saying that self is normal and the other is abnormal. And this is so much a part of every emotional system that involves us all, that unless it happens, then something is wrong."

### The Resolution

Bowen as coach advised:
- If she wanted to proceed on course of being a self
- **"If she didn't get mad at her parents and her family for their negative reaction"**
- Don't retaliate
- Don't get mad and go away from them
- "Just continue on her course, then it wouldn't be long before the family would change"

**Outcome**:
- She proceeded with marriage
- Family had nothing to do with her for few months
- She was able to not get angry with them

**Verbatim**: "When you get angry with them about it, then that sets up the emotional reaction, which pulls people back into the family system."

- Within brief time: "She had come to be regarded as one of the stronger, more resourceful persons in the family"
- "She was considered now a person of conviction, and she was much closer to the family"

### Bowen's Personal Example: Family Research

**First presentation to staff**: "Initial reaction was one of applause. It was over positive applause."

**Then within days**: Messages from senior members that his interest in family "had to do with an unresolved Oedipal conflict, or I hadn't resolved my own emotional problems. So neurotic conflict made me get interested in family."

**His reaction**: "They might be right. So I sort of gave up the family effort or not as intense and had a look at myself for a time."

**Second presentation**: "Same reaction was more intense. This time, there was less applause and there was more negative, you're sick. You better do something about it."

**Pattern repeated ~3 times** until: "Eventually I was sure enough in myself that I was going on with family that I proceeded anyway."

**Verbatim**: "If at that time I had known that these were predictable steps as a person in any system, whether in his own family, in the work system, or any other place, these are predictable steps, then it wouldn't have taken me as long as it did to deal with that in that work situation."

### Early Career Feeling

**Verbatim**: "I remember in my early years in psychiatry... I had a very clear feeling within me that if I ever reached the place of knowing exactly what I believed about psychiatry, and I ever had the courage to say it in open forum, I would be drummed out of the profession."

**Verbatim**: "You're supposed to believe what you're supposed to believe. And if you believe something different, then you're some kind of an oddity or something's wrong with you."

He persisted → same three steps applied → rejecting relationship system → made it through → relationship system more accepting.

### Key Principle: Don't Attack Back

**Verbatim**: "If you believe what you believe, then you don't have to go out and attack the beliefs of others. And you can respect what they believe and you hope they respect you. And if you believe it enough, you're sure enough, you don't have to go out and attack. And if you attack, then you're pulled right back into the emotional system."

**Verbatim**: "If you can maintain your posture and you don't get mad and you keep in relationship with them, then finally after going through this period of sort of internal turmoil, you're on your new position and where you stand and what you believe for, then the people are accepting of you again."

---

## Part D: The I Position vs. No-Self

### Using the World's Knowledge as Authority

**Verbatim**: "I would say most people, it is far more comfortable and less anxiety producing to believe what you're supposed to believe than to believe what you really believe."

**Verbatim**: "I would say that most people don't define what they believe, but they use what others believe."

**Sources people use instead of self**:
- Religion: "It is right that..."
- Philosophy: "The truth is that..."
- Culture: "This is the way it is or the way to do it"
- Authority: "The law says that..."
- Science: "Science has proven that..."

**Verbatim**: "This person relates to his environment, not as a self, but as a sort of a conveyor of the world's knowledge. So, he's a no self."

### When No-Self is Functional

**Example**: Military service — "Army regulations say that"

**Verbatim**: "Self is not in it. He is an interpreter of what some authority behind him says."

In some contexts, better for the system to be a no-self.

### Highest Level of Differentiation

**Verbatim**: "The highest differentiated person is one who uses the world's knowledge, however it works best for him. But then in relating to others, he would say, I believe, this is what I stand for, and this is what I will do and I won't do."

### The Hodgepodge Problem

**Verbatim**: "In all of this world's knowledge, there are all kinds of conflicting viewpoints. So most people put together a hodgepodge."

Without being a self: "You don't have to bother about clarifying where you stand. You can say, such and such believes that, and something over here that's completely in conflict with it, that believes it, and you don't have to put yourself on the line."

### Ballot Example: Discovering Self Through Reflection

Bowen received mail ballot with two propositions, each with space for comments.

**Initial reaction**: "This is a good thing. I'm for number one... I'm for this."

**But because of comment space**: "I began to think, well, do I have any comments about this? I must have some. So I started really thinking about it."

**Outcome**: "I ended up by writing several pages of what I believed about man and the situation. And I'm vigorously opposed to both propositions, only because I'd taken enough time to think it through."

**Verbatim**: "I would not have thought through without somebody giving me the stimulus to do it. So I ended up with a real solid I position on these two things."

**Verbatim**: "I believe this is one of the biggest things that sort of contributes to no selves... how many of these things are there that you'd have a definite stand about if you just developed, took enough time to think it through."

### Two Types of No-Self

1. **The Compliant Person**: "Goes along with the system and says, this is so, this is how it is"

2. **The Rebel**:

**Verbatim**: "The rebel is responding to the emotional system. The rebel has an equal state of no self. The rebel's position in life is determined by the majority or by the family or by the establishment or whatever you call it."

**Verbatim**: "There's the stand of the establishment and the rebel is exactly 180 degrees away. He has no stand for himself. He's attacking the other. If the majority stand changes, then his changes. He's completely dependent on what the majority believes for his level of pseudo self."

---

## Part E: Therapy Technique — The Triangular Method

### Structure

Working with "two most important people in the system plus me as a potential triangle"

**Verbatim**: "I believe to be one of the high roads to a differentiation of self."

### The Stuck-Together Problem

**Verbatim**: "The lower the level of differentiation, the more these people are stuck together. The more they don't have the freedom to move about. They can move about only as a twosome. They don't have the individual freedom unless they get mad and go away from each other."

**Verbatim**: "Nobody resolved anything with this."

### The Communication Method

Old method (early days): "Encourage these people to talk to each other, express feelings to each other"
- Results in "tightening of the emotional system between them"

**Faster method**:
1. One spouse talks to Bowen (therapist)
2. Bowen keeps it "very factual, objective, sterile, and as non-emotional as possible"
3. Bowen asks other spouse: "What is your reaction to that? Were you listening? What were you thinking?"

**Verbatim**: "The goal of this is to get into the intrapsychic process going on in each of these people."

### Why This Works

**Problem with direct communication**:
- "If this one talks to the other spouse, there's emotion in that"
- "The other spouse is reacting to the emotion"
- "They're not thinking, they're not objective"
- "They can't hear. They're reacting instead of listening"

**With therapist as intermediary**:
- "When this one talks to me, the emotion that would go into it, if it talks to her, is out"
- "Then this one can listen"

### Common Early Outcome

**Verbatim**: "I had one recently with a wife saying, this is one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. For the first time in my life, the first time since we've been married, I am finding out what my husband thinks."

- He is "defining who he is, what he thinks, what he feels, where he stands"
- "For the first time she's hearing it"
- Same in reverse

### The Paradox of Emotional Connectedness

**Verbatim**: "As these two proceed, then the emotional connectedness becomes less and less between them."

**Anticipating objection**: "Others would say, oh, this is terrible. You know, they don't love each other or something like that."

**Verbatim**: "The more each can be a self, the closer they can be to each other and the freer they can be. And the freer, they are now free to express feelings."

### Therapist Triangulation Warning

**Verbatim**: "All you have to do is begin feeling with or taking sides or get caught in a triangle and self's in it. So the goal is to be able to recognize this when it happens and to do something about getting self out."

### Time Required

**Verbatim**: "This is a process that takes time... for the average family, fairly well motivated family, medium level neurotic problems... a period of months, year, or two."

**More frequent appointments don't help**:

**Verbatim**: "I have not been able to speed up this process by doing more frequent appointments. The things that happen with more frequent appointments is I'm much more vulnerable to this and to them really being dependent on the therapy."

**Verbatim**: "The amount of time that it takes for people to do this is just requires time on the calendar."

### Basic Growth vs. Symptom Relief

**Verbatim**: "If you're thinking of therapy in terms like this, you're not thinking in terms of easing symptoms, alleviating symptoms or making it better. You're thinking of some what I would call basic growth. Basic growth term is achieved when somebody is more of a self."

---

## Part F: Working with One Person / The I Position in Action

### Chain Effect on Children

**Verbatim**: "It's predictable, that if these two parents can get, become relatively differentiated from each other then their kids automatically become more secure, well-defined selves."

**Verbatim**: "If these two people can change, then you don't have to work with children. It is automatic."

### Who Can Differentiate

**Verbatim**: "You couldn't work with a child who is still financially and emotionally, is financially dependent and living with parents."

Why:

**Verbatim**: "It has to be somebody who can risk the chance of differentiation because when somebody starts differentiating, the family system is going to say to them, don't you do that. If you do that, we are going to disinherit you. And the emotional system will do it."

**Verbatim**: "Somebody who is dependent and unable to support self financially is not going to be able to do much with the family system."

### Emotional Upheaval is Necessary

**Verbatim**: "Unless some version of it happens somewhere, then I would doubt that differentiation is taking place because each step up this scale is an emotional upheaval, there's an emotional turmoil, it's something to be worked through for the person who makes the effort."

### Where It's Easiest/Hardest

**Verbatim**: "It is hardest to be aware of this, to be an observer, and to define a self in relationship to one spouse than to any other person. This is the person we're most dependent on. It's harder to see it, it's harder to find the stand."

**Verbatim**: "It is easier to do in the significant more peripheral relationships."

### The I Position: Getting Off the Back of the Other

**Core principle**: "You get on the back of the other by directing the self of the other instead of directing one's own self."

**Example**: Husband and wife, route home disagreement
- Early marriage: fights about parkway vs. business district
- Wife gave up, lived with it
- After therapy work, wife tried again: "Honey, would you please turn and let's go up the parkway"
- Husband blew up: accused her of "treating him like a child and being a bossy woman"
- Wife came to session thinking "the problem is over in her husband"

**Bowen's intervention**: "She tell the husband the very same thing without using you"
- "No matter how you said it, you did say you turn"
- "How about just changing that and say the same thing using only I"

**Result**:
- Wife: "I do not like to ride through that busy business district"
- Husband: "Okay" (as he turned into parkway)

**Verbatim**: "This is the magic of the I position, and speaking of I, I, I, and of getting off the back of the other, which is you are so and so, you should do, you, you, you, directing you."

### With Children: Progressive Refinement

**First attempt**: "I don't like what you are doing, and if you continue to do that, then I am going to do so and so"
- Still a mixture of I and you
- "Can be interpreted and probably is a threat"

**Better**: "If you continue to do that, then I am going to take this posture to you"

**Best**: "I do not like the way the situation goes in this house and if this situation continues then I am going to change some of the things or change my posture to it"

**Result**: "They're not fussing at the child, they're giving the child an option of misbehaving or not misbehaving. Magical things can take place."

### Self Defined by Action, Not Words

**Verbatim**: "A self is never defined in words. It's defined only when you can take an action stand."

**Verbatim**: "When self can take an action stand that's not punitive. It's just this is the ground I stand on, I believe in this, I'm going to stand here. I'm not going to, I give you the privilege of standing over there. I'm not going to hit you nor punish you. But I'm going to stand here and this is where I stand."

**Verbatim**: "If this one can continue to stand there when the other rejects and threatens to run away or threatens to withdraw or whatever without attacking back, then similar changes occur throughout the family."
