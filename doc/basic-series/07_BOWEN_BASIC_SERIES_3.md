## Overview

This lecture covers two concepts:
1. **Multigenerational Transmission Process** — nuclear family emotional process across generations
2. **Sibling Positions** — importance of birth order in personality and therapy

Bowen notes candidly: "I can never be as free and un-uptight on camera as I can doing one to an audience."

## Part A: Multigenerational Transmission Process

### Definition

**Verbatim**: "The multigenerational transmission process is the phenomenon I talked about last week, which is the nuclear family emotional process taken over multiple generations."

- Emotional process in nuclear family = predictable
- Question: What's the outcome when this proceeds over multiple generations?

### Review: Fixed Amount of Immaturity

From Part 2: "There is a fixed amount of immaturity in a nuclear family which has to be handled in one of three ways."

Bowen used arbitrary figure 60 — "It doesn't make any difference what kind of a figure one takes for this as long as one's aware it's a fixed amount."

**Caution on correlation with scale**:
- He wants it correlated with scale of differentiation
- "But one has to remember that this is not defined with, yet with that degree of exactness"

**Verbatim**: "I think one day we'll have a way of sort of judging that amount and knowing ahead of time, knowing when people get married, being able to predict what's going to happen in that marriage and the lives of these two people."

### Core Mechanism

The child who gets **maximum projection** = **less differentiated than parents** = **impaired for life**

**Verbatim**: "The siblings in a family grow up with varying degrees of differentiation of self."

**Critical clarification**: The transmission process "doesn't deal with the immaturity that is handled by marital conflict or sickness in a spouse. This is thinking primarily of that that is transmitted into the next generation."

**Universal presence**: "There's no such thing as a family in which this process is not present. It's not a question of whether it's present or not, but to what degree."

### Functional vs. Basic Level (Detailed)

**Borrowing and lending of strength** makes exact scale values hard to assign:

**Example**:
- Before marriage: husband and wife at equal functioning levels
- After marriage: husband functioning at 50, wife at 25
- **Basic level** = halfway between (37.5)
- Husband = over-functioning, wife = under-functioning

**Verbatim**: "When I say spouses marry others with the same basic level of differentiation, I mean this base level and not functional levels."

**Functional shifts**:
- Someone complimented → "walking on clouds" → functioning better
- Someone criticized → functioning down
- Both = functional shifts, not basic level changes

**Scale position affects variability**:
- Lower on scale → greater functional seesaw (wide swings)
- Higher on scale → very little seesaw (function more on par)

**Verbatim**: "I caution people, don't get into the thing of trying to assign exact values to this thing. I'm trying to illustrate a principle rather than to categorize people specifically."

### The Downward Transmission (Illustrated)

**Generation 1**: Two parents at 40
- Maximum projection → oldest daughter → ends at 30
- Moderate involvement → son → ends at 40 (same as parents)
- Outside system → child → ends at 50

**Generation 2**: The 30 marries another 30
- Their child with maximum projection → ends at 20

**Generation 3**: The 20 marries another 20
- Their child with maximum projection → ends at 10
- Now vulnerable to "all kinds of problems"

**Verbatim**: "The lower we get on the scale, the more vulnerable these people are to all kinds of, the more extreme the mechanisms they have to use to deal with this immaturity or the anxiety, which is a product of it."

### Schizophrenia as Multigenerational Outcome

**Verbatim**: "My thesis about schizophrenia is that schizophrenia develops way down in this part of the scale. And that has made me say in the past that schizophrenia is a minimum of three generations."

- Going from "pretty good level of functioning down into a very poor level"
- Family with schizophrenia = "an impaired family"
- "These people have less flexibility. They're more fixed in the way they do things."

### The Upward Movement (Simultaneous)

**Critical balance**: At the same time as downward movement:

**Verbatim**: "At the very same time, people are slipping down the scale from generation to generation. There are also others that are going up. And there are others who are remaining fairly stable."

**Example**: Parents at 10 can have child relatively out of process → 20 → marries 20 → going back up

**Response to criticism of pessimism**:
**Verbatim**: "People have said this is... a very pessimistic thing. And so what's pessimistic about it? If it accurately describes the human phenomenon."

### Conflict/Sickness Absorbs Projection

If nuclear family handles immaturity through conflict or spouse illness → less projected to children

**Example**: Family with severe illness in mother (drinking problem, physical illness)
- Most immaturity absorbed by symptom
- Children may come off "as high as the parents or maybe even higher"
- Little family projection process

**Verbatim**: "There might be one generation or several in which the family handles its immaturity by conflict or by symptoms in which the children come off pretty good."

More generations of absorption → more generations needed to reach schizophrenia level.

### Predictive Validity (Research Method)

**Verbatim**: "How does one check the accuracy of this kind of a theoretical postulation?"

**Method**:
1. Take family history from ~100 years ago (nuclear family data only)
2. Give data to research assistant who understands system
3. Have them predict next generation, then next, then next
4. Compare predictions to known outcomes (4-6 generations back, answers known)

**Verbatim**: "I've been satisfied with the predictability of this theoretical system. In other words, just from knowing the nuclear family, you can know pretty well what kinds of children they're going to have and who's going to get the problem and how they're going to turn out in life."

## Part B: Sibling Position

### Walter Toman's Contribution

**Verbatim**: "I'd been in family research some, oh, six or seven years when Walter Toman came out with his book, Family Constellation. And I think this is still one of the great pieces of work that's been done."

**Toman's situation**:
- Had body of knowledge that "didn't fit with any other theoretical system"
- "Didn't know what to do with it"
- First edition dust jacket: "Family Constellation, A Psychological Game"
- "Almost as if Toman didn't know where to put it"

**Core claim**: "A large amount of the personality characteristics of a person is determined by the family configuration in which he grew up."

### Toman's Ten Profiles

1. Oldest brother of brothers
2. Youngest brother of brothers
3. Oldest sister of sisters
4. Youngest sister of sisters
5. Oldest brother of sisters
6. Youngest brother of sisters
7. Oldest sister of brothers
8. Youngest sister of brothers
9. Only child
10. Twins

**Using the profiles**: With these ten, you can derive any configuration:
- Middle sister of three = more like oldest OR youngest OR combination
- Three boys middle = more like one ahead or one after
- Four girls, any position derivable

**Five-six year rule**: If more than 5-6 years between children, the later-born becomes either only child or first in new series.

### Bowen's Addition: Family Projection Process Effect

**Toman studied "normal" families** — didn't account for family projection process.

**Example**: Two daughters, oldest is object of projection
- Oldest "continues to be a little girl" — doesn't develop oldest characteristics
- "Ends up essentially more the baby"
- Next daughter (less involved) → becomes like oldest sister

**Only child variation**:
- Low projection → characteristics of oldest
- High projection → more like youngest

### Importance in Therapy

**Verbatim**: "If there's one bit of information I think that would be most important for me in doing a family history, it would be to find out where this person was in the sibling spread."

**Verbatim**: "If you know you're dealing with an oldest or a youngest, you already know volumes about this person, all things being equal."

### "All Things Being Equal"

Key phrase from Toman:

**Verbatim**: "He would say in this family, all things being equal, this should be an oldest daughter of daughters and this youngest. But all things in this family weren't equal and she was, this one was the object of the family projection process."

### Expectations Transmission

**Verbatim**: "I believe that in families the expectation from the present generation is communicated to the future generation. No matter if the parents say, I don't expect anything of my children. They are free to be whatever they wish to be."

**Pattern**:
- Oldest daughter → acquires majority of expectations for women
- Oldest son → acquires expectations for men
- Oldest son = "most responsible one, will feel most responsible for the family"

### Only Child Solutions

**Example**: Only child who is a girl, family has expectations for both boys and girls

**Optimum solution**:
- Girl assumes responsibility for women
- Marries husband who assumes responsibility for men
- Husband from "exploding family" who moves out emotionally and joins wife's family

**Less efficient solutions**:
1. Only girl picks up more expectations for boys than girls
   - Example: "Very successful woman who makes a name for herself in her own right and then she marries a husband who is known as the husband of"
2. Woman picks up boy expectations, doesn't marry, fulfills what boys would have done
3. Girl tries to be "big mother" (common lower on scale)
   - "When she becomes big mother, she becomes an immature big mother"
   - Tries, sees self as failure, withdraws from family

### Clinical Case Example

**Family configuration**:
- Husband: youngest in big family of siblings (significant distance from others)
- Wife: oldest, had worked hard to help problem-filled family, gave up in late teens, married out

**Children**:
1. Oldest daughter (10) — diagnosed childhood psychosis, institutionalized
2. Son (7-8) — physical defect (heart), hospitalized after sister institutionalized
3. Third child (6) — picking up symptoms

**Key observation about youngest husband**:
**Verbatim**: "If there's anybody that ever grew up that was almost programmed to be a baby, it's this husband."

**Wife's pattern**: "Originally programmed to be a responsible person" but "bugged out of that role"

**What happens in therapy**: "Big mother to little boy" enacted in front of you

**What happens in individual therapy with the husband**:
- "He probably wouldn't be motivated for psychotherapy"
- "He's going to be playing little boy"
- "You can spend an awful long time and he's still playing little boy to the therapist who is big daddy or parent or whatever"

**Clinical note about oldest daughter**: At age 4, "volunteering and going to, trying to sweep the house, do household work"
- "Not a mother that was asking or expecting this child to do it"
- "A kind of an automatic response to the family"
- "An exaggeration of what happened to this mother and her feeling of responsibility"

**Bowen's recommendation**: Work with most motivated spouse (the wife)
- "I think that original orientation to life, that responsibility could be kindled in her if she could find a way to be responsibly responsible instead of being irresponsibly responsible"
- Family with big problem "worked out very well in therapy"

### Oldest-Youngest Marriage Pattern

**Verbatim**: "This is one of the most familiar patterns... the oldest would marry a youngest and the youngest would marry an oldest."

**Two youngest marry**: One will play oldest/responsible role, other will play irresponsible/child role.

### Family Projection Process Identification (Retrospective)

**Method**: Ask about each child in turn — "How did this one do in life?"

Questions:
- Occupation?
- Married? How many children?
- Where do they live?
- How are they doing?

**Pattern emerges**: "There will be one somewhere in this who was the black sheep, the scapegoated one, the one that does poorly."

**Therapy implication**: "If the family you're working with happens to be the scapegoated one, it's a little less optimistic for therapy than if it was in one of the better functioning ones that is stressed to the point of symptoms."

## Part C: Taking Family History

### What Bowen Wants to Know Early

1. **Sibling position** — "from the beginning"
2. **Relationship patterns** brought from families of origin
3. **Pattern of adjustment** — how much conflict, sickness, projection
4. **When pattern breaks down** — beginning of symptoms
5. **Symptom progression** — calendar year by year with **exact dates**

### Importance of Dates

**Verbatim**: "It's important to get dates."

- Families will say "when so-and-so was in third grade"
- "I want to know what year was that and how old was the child. And then how old were the parents then."
- Want to know family configuration when pressure symptom first erupted

**Reason**: "Often you find out that the symptom that pops down here in a child... there's often something that happened back up in this family."

### Family Life Stages

1. **Two-person system**: Period when couple marries, finding way of living together
2. **Three-person system**: Addition of first child (different pattern than two-person)
3. **Four-person system**: Addition of second child (pattern shifts again)
4. **Multiple children**: Less dramatic change with each addition
5. **Intact family period**: ~10 years with most kids at home
6. **Kids leaving**: Marriage, moving out — new adjustment pattern

**Verbatim**: "I want to get these adjustment patterns through each stage of life."

### Informant Caveat

**Verbatim**: "When you ask any one informant you've got to always be aware that this is distorted information, that this is from memory."

### Multigenerational History Taking

Bowen has gone back 100-150 years:
- "Not a lot of details but you can get the kinds of information that's necessary for making these predictions"
- Example: 1822 — find two people that married, where they were, how children were added

**Verbatim**: "It's amazing how accurate this can be and what kinds of information you can get that far back."
