# Reproduction, Adoption, Fertility from EC

Ideas for diagram symbology. A list of different ways reproduction plays out.

## Failed Fertility Treatment

to account for attempts (e.g., IVF) without a pregnancy (regardless of whether the pregnancy resulted in miscarriage or in delivery) - some people experience these as losses akin to miscarriage and they often keep track of how old the person would be now if they had existed.  

## Non-completed Adoption

Some pre-adoptive parents get matched with a child but for various reasons it does not continue through to a finalized placement.  They can experience this loss as akin to a miscarriage and also track how old the child would have been.  Could possibly use same symbol as failed fertility treatment but I don't think they are the same thing in that you will know the sex of the non-completed adopted child.  

## Pregnancy

this symbol could (?) benefit from a small number inside of it to indicate how many months along the person is in the pregnancy at the time of diagramming

## Abortion

same as in pregnancy - needs a number to indicate at how many weeks?

## Embryo Donation

A person could be biologically related to neither of their parents, but have been carried in their mother's womb and of course are raised by their parents but it's not considered "adoption".  Can be relevant for the purposes of emotional process in families if, for example, the fact of this is kept secret and a person thinks they are biologically related but aren't, etc.  

## Egg Donation

A person could be biologically related to their father, but not to their mother who carried them in her womb.  Also raised by their parents but it's not considered "adoption".  Some donors are anonymous, but some are friends or family members.  

## Sperm Donation

A person could be biologically related to their mother who carried them in her womb, but not to their father.  Also raised by their parents but it's not considered "adoption".  There have been some examples of very highly emotionally charged situations where irresponsible practices allowed for 100s of children to be fathered by a single man, resulting in people finding out as adults when they do 23andme tests, eg, that they have hundreds of half-siblings and some have even found out they married a half-sibling, etc.

## Surrogacy

A person could be fully biologically related to their parents, but have been carried in the womb of another woman.  In some cases this fact is not particularly relevant for tracking emotional process; other times this could be important.

## Miscarriage

same as in pregnancy - needs a number to indicate at how many weeks?

## Stillbirth

could use same symbol as miscarriage, but people who have stillbirths often experience it differently than miscarriages

## Adoption

You could do this one of two ways and I definitely have a stronger preference for the second way.  

*The first way:*  Have a solid line connecting the adopted person to their biological parents and a dashed line connecting them to their adoptive parents.  This maintains consistency such that biological offspring are indicated the same way for all people.  It's not ideal, though, that a dashed line is also used to indicate separation in a pair-bond (since adoption is not about separation), but like you said, it is about pair-bonds so it's not the same category.  

*The second way (my preference):*  Have a solid line connecting the adopted person to any parents they have - bio or adopted.  This is more consistent with Bowen theory, which says that adoptive family emotional process may be more relevant than bio family emotional process depending on age of person at time of adoption.  It will be obvious that the person is adopted without needing dashed lines to designate it if you include all of the parents (bio and adopted) on the diagram, which IMHO should be the standard practice for diagramming all adopted people/families.  It also addresses the possibility of "chosen parents"/chosen family, where people consider certain parental figures not connected to them via either bio ties or adoptive legal status to be like a parent to them.  Those relationships could be the ones indicated using dashed lines, rather than adoptive relationships.  This would also be consistent with Bowen theory.

## Foster Parents

Some adoptees were moved around quite a few times from one foster home to another before being adopted and those foster parents (especially of long duration) would be important to track.
