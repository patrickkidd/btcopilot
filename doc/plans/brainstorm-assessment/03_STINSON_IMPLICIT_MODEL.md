# Patrick Stinson 2020: The Implicit Model

**Source**: Presentation transcript from `stinson-2020-the-implicit-model.md`

**Date Captured**: 2026-01-04

**Presenter**: Patrick Stinson (first person throughout)

**Context**: This presentation represents Patrick's theoretical development over "more than a couple years" — his attempt to articulate what exactly a Bowen coach provides value for, and to develop a cross-species, objective framework for understanding guidance, prediction, and behavioral adaptation.

---

## The Central Question

> "What exactly is a Bowen coach getting paid for if they don't fix anything?"

This question is about explaining Bowen theory to someone who doesn't know it — the elevator pitch problem.

Related questions this presentation addresses:
- What is the elevator pitch for Bowen theory?
- What is the theory of change in Bowen theory?

---

## The Elevator Pitch (Three-Clause Statement)

Patrick's best formulation:

1. **The way a person understands a problem determines what they do to solve it.**
2. **The validity of that understanding determines the efficacy of that solution.**
3. **The goal in the application of Bowen theory is to assist a person making their model of the problem as accurate as possible.**

### Key Term Choices

- **"Understanding"** replaces "thinks" — broader, because the concept goes deeper
- **"Validity"** — points to objectivity
- **"Model"** — the device that produces prediction

---

## Overview of the Implicit Model Concept

### Definition (Short Form)

> "The implicit model is a guidance system. It is a guidance system of the context of the system, the context that the system confronts. It's that which guides behavior, an implicit meaning in a living thing."

### The Cross-Species Problem

Patrick is wrestling with anthropocentric terms:
- **Objectivity** — "What is objectivity to ants and bacteria?"
- **Thinking** — "Is thinking merely a human function or is it an elaboration of a basic pattern? And can it be described in such terms?"
- **Religion** — "What exactly is religion functionally? What's the function of religion in a cross species manner without anthropomorphizing?"

### Terms Placed Off Limits

**Consciousness** is explicitly rejected:

> "I don't like the term because I'd never heard an objective definition of it that doesn't require another subjective term like awareness or experience or even choice or free will. And the reason I'm saying that these are subjective is because they tend to self reference... it's just the circular definitions don't do it for me. I think there's a ton of subjectivity in there that most people who define this in public don't realize. And I'll stand by that."

### The Darwinian Truth Problem

This is flagged early as a key issue:

> "What do you do when somebody has a heuristic or a model of a problem that is factually inaccurate but more adaptive, at least for a certain context."

> "When is it that a truth is more adaptive than a fact?"

---

## Foundational Definitions

### Theory

> "Theory is information about how something works. A theory can be used to make predictions about the thing that the theory describes."

### Model

> "A model is a device that produces that prediction. A model is a simulation of the thing described by the theory. It's not the thing itself. And that's why it's called a model."

### The Weather Model Analogy

> "There's theories that describe how the weather works, right? And then there's these theories can be used to construct a model that predicts the weather. And the model may be a computer program or an algorithm worked out with paper and pencil or just an if then statement run through someone's head. And a weather model is not the weather itself. So it's not all the things that go into weather. It's not the water, gases, photons, particles of dirt, rock, etc. It's an algorithm that calculates what all those materials do."

### Critical Point About Error

> "Every model predicts with error because the model is not the same as the thing being modeled. And so error is going to be a central variable here in this implicit model concept."

---

## The Explicit/Implicit Distinction

### Core Assumptions

1. Every person has a model of a problem they're dealing with
2. If they're behaving, they have a model determining the behavior
3. The model is determined by a theory
4. A person's theory may or may not be accurate
5. **A person has both a model that they think they have and a model that their behavior actually reveals**

### Key Distinction (Verbatim)

> "The model that they think they have is an explicit theory. The model that actually guides their behavior is an implicit model. Key distinction."

### Definitions

- **Explicit model**: "When a person explains it, verbally codifies it on paper or with building materials"
- **Implicit model**: "When it's implied or when it operates automatically within the individual"

### Ontological Status

> "The term implicit model, it's only a concept. So if you look in the organism, you're not going to find it. The organism functions as if it has an implicit model. The concept is just an artifact of subjectivity. It's just a tool we use to understand it's not a fact."

This connects to Darwinian truth: "when you have something that's not a fact, but it's adaptive nevertheless to use it."

---

## Application to Bowen Theory

### The Core Claim

> "Bowen theory describes the behavior of the implicit model in the human family. Bowen theory is an explicit theory because it's written down and spoken out loud. The suggestion here is that the family has an implicit model that determines every aspect of its behavior. It is an implicit model because it operates automatically within the family."

### The Stunning Equation

> "The implicit model is the emotional system itself. It's the natural guidance system that is being studied."

### The Shocking Discovery

Patrick describes watching Iain Couzin's models and having a realization:

> "I was sitting there watching Ian cousins models, and I thought, well, we've got it in Bowen theory, and I have the skills to write this kind of code. I can just write it down. Oh my God, all I have to do is do it. I'll do it tomorrow at noon, you know. And I sat down and went, wait a second. I don't know what the variables are and I don't know how they interact. And it's just not there. It doesn't exist yet. It has to be developed."

### What Bowen Theory Actually Is (and Isn't)

> "The implicit model of the human family has actually not been discovered, because if it did, an explicit model of the family's implicit model would exist. There would be a family simulator."

> "Bowen theory only describes what the family emotional system does under specified conditions. It doesn't define how it accomplishes this. In this sense, Bowen theory simply defines the requirements for how an explicit model of the family would behave."

### What a True Family Simulator Would Be

> "Such an explicit model would define the universal script that every family member would follow from their own unique point of view. That's effectively an agent model. The result would be a family simulation that would automatically exhibit the emergent behaviors described in at least six of the eight concepts of Bowen theory without those concepts being explicitly programmed in, meaning they're emergent behaviors, not determined behavior... They automatically appear at the level of the group when all you've done is programmed a universal script for the individuals."

---

## How Explicit Models Change Implicit Models

### The Bleeding Effect

> "It does appear that when a thinking system defines and refines an explicit model about its own behavior, the that the change in the explicit model bleeds into the implicit model. The implicit model is then changed."

### The Triangle Example

> "For example, seeing a triangle can actually change the level of automatic reactivity a person exhibits within that triangle."

### Objectivity Defined

> "The goal is for the model to predict the future context with as little errors as possible. That's the goal of this implicit model. A word for this ability may be objectivity."

### Cross-Species Objectivity

> "This begins to hint at the possibility of a cross species definition of objectivity... The concept of an implicit model makes a cross species definition of objectivity possible. May not be the right one, but it makes it possible."

---

## The Application of Bowen Theory (Reformulated)

> "Maybe the application of Bowen theory is the effort to make the theory of a problem as accurate as possible."

Key point about differentiation:

> "Differentiation in the coach, knowing theory, thinking systems, all this stuff all play into this singular goal."

### The Automaticity Thesis

> "The thesis here is that an implicit model is not a tool that a person chooses to use. It determines. This is the concept implies that it determines every aspect of that person's behavior. It's automatic. It is that which is automatic."

### The Research Function

> "The proposition here is that when someone studies their own behavior, studies a person's someone else's behavior or their own behavior, they are inferring that person's implicit model. This points to the function of the research effort, whether in formal research or coaching, or differentiating itself."

### Why Bowen Prioritized Theory

> "As the coachees or the person being coached, explicit theory of the problem changes. Then both the implicit and explicit models of the problem automatically change with it to varying degree. As far as I can tell, this is a way of understanding why? Bowen repeatedly wrote that he was more interested in developing theory than merely developing therapy because therapy is determined by the model and the model is determined by the theory. And advances in theory automatically convert to advances in therapy."

---

## Emotion, Value, and Thinking in the Implicit Model

### Reference to Contemporary Theorists

Patrick references:
- **Lisa Feldman Barrett** — "famous for showing that there's not discrete emotions, feelings... using this term prediction to organize how behavior is guided"
- **Antonio Damasio** — "using the term emotion and describing it often in terms basically saying that it always has a positive and negative valence and an intensity and that is never neutral"

### Feldman Barrett's Contributions

- Predictions are constructed in a real time stream (not discrete sporadic events)
- "Behavior itself is an ongoing prediction"
- You can change automatic predictions (transference example)
- Making predictions more accurate

### Feldman Barrett's Limitations (from Patrick's view)

- Does not effectively distinguish emotion and feeling as in Bowen theory
- Does not use concepts that scale to multiple levels of analysis
- Does not address co-construction of emergent phenomena of guidance across levels (individual and family)

### Damasio's Contributions

- Emotion always has positive/negative valence and intensity — never neutral
- Integral to the act of perceiving
- Feelings = "the brain working in contact with the body by definition"
- Definition of self: "the brain's sense of the over functioning and under functioning balance of the body's physiological systems via sensational information"

## The Fundamental Challenge for Any Organism

### The Core Assumption

> "One way to conceptualize the fundamental challenge for any organism is to persist in the face of change."

### Caution About Anthropomorphizing Evolution

> "I think it's easy to anthropomorphize evolution as if there's an agent behind it, as if it's acting out of will or something like that. And you know that comes out in people thinking and talking as if they can actually have an impact on evolution. Which I think is actually illogical."

> "If you're going to assign a goal then you're kind of inserting subjectivity in there."

### The Clinical/Coaching Challenge

> "It might be assumed then that the fundamental clinical challenge is to assist a person or a family in adopting to change."

---

## The Predictive Model Thesis

### Core Proposition

> "An organism adapts to change by relying on a predictive model built into the species. This implicit model is encoded in the organism's physiology, just as the currently active algorithm of a computer is encoded in its physical network of transistors. That is that the model exists in the information domain and not the physical domain."

### What the Model Represents

> "The predictions generated by the implicit model are, theoretically speaking, a perfect statistical representation of the organism's context over the course of its evolutionary past. Perfect statistical representation."

### How the Model Functions

> "The model therefore functions to make statistical predictions of the current context based on what is perceived in the present moment and recalled conditions of the past. Statistical here, meaning just probabilistic, it's making a best guess."

### Error as the Central Variable

> "As with all statistical predictions, these predictions contain a degree of error."

### The Struggle of Life = Error

> "The concept here, the assumption is that the struggle of life equivalent to this error."

---

## Examples of Prediction Error

Patrick provides several examples to illustrate prediction failure:

1. **Job rejection**: "One person's continually rejected for jobs, while another is not. So what is it that the first person was not able to predict about their rejections in retrospect, why put forth the effort at all if that's the reality? There was a failure of prediction."

2. **Illness from clothing**: "Another person may be constantly sick, in part because they repeatedly choose improper clothing for the day's weather. So their behavior operates on the erroneous prediction that they are adequately prepared for the day."

3. **Clumsiness**: "Another person may waste time in a busy day because they drop their belongings every few minutes... their quote, clumsiness implies that they incorrectly predicted that they had a sufficiently firm grip on their phone, or the balance in their shoes or whatever it was, or eyes on the road. There's a constant failure to predict."

### The Accumulation Principle

> "Errors in prediction accumulate from moment to moment throughout the day, leading to an overall ease or disease while moving through life in general."

### Connection to Multigenerational Transmission

> "This could be one aspect of progression and regression in multi generational transmission."

### Relationship to Differentiation

> "Considering the base basal level of this concept, it's going to be right there next to differentiation, or maybe just a slant on differentiation. The question of their relation is a big one, important one."

### Scope of the Implicit Model

> "The model is implicit. It functions outside of awareness. It governs the function of the heart and diaphragm just as much as the deliberate choice of the clothing."

---

## Emotion Redefined

### The Equation

> "For the purposes of this thesis, emotion is synonymous with action."

### The Rocket Analogy

> "Emotion is directed by predictions from an organism's model. The model functions to carry out something like the calculations for landing a guided rocket on a distant asteroid. And these calculations represent predictions based on the laws or the theories of physics. Emotion is something like the energetic propulsion of the rocket and the movement of its various control mechanisms, right in accordance with the calculations. So the energy is in line with the calculations, but they are not the same thing."

### Formal Definition

> "Emotion is the observable physical outcome of a statistical best guess for what the context will be. The model's prediction occurs at the information level and emotion occurs at the physical level."

### Why "Context" Not "Environment"

> "I'm using the word context instead of environment here because the context is broader and encompasses the state of everything in the universe at that moment. It includes what is external to the organism and what is internal to the organism. Environment just always kind of sounds like it means outside."

### Emotion is Always Partially Appropriate

> "Because the models prediction is a perfect imprint of the past, and the events of the past are more accurate than inaccurate predictors of the future by virtue of the organism's survival, then emotion is always at least partially appropriate."

### The Balance Principle

> "This is why emotion can neither be ignored nor allowed to fully determine action. The goal is to get the expression of emotion in as line with the present context as possible. This is about efficiency. And organisms that direct emotion accurately through extreme changes in context tend to survive."

---

## Value Defined

### Value = Guidance

> "Value is the value in evaluation. Value is the product of the implicit model. And it is the result of combining sensory input for the moment from the memory of sensory input in the past."

> "In the implicit model concept value represents guidance generated by the model. They're synonymous so far."

### Structure of Value

> "Value can be conceptualized as a desirability valence and the intensity of that desirability. It's whether something perceived is desirable or undesirable and how much that is. So go towards the desirable and away from the undesirable."

### Emergent Value System

> "If emotion is automatic and defined as having valence plus intensity, then we have an emergent value system built into biology. Or you could say there is an emergent ethic co created in the interaction of natural living systems."

### Value as Technical Term

> "Value is the guidance which is the result of an evaluative process which effectively I am equating to what people generally say as the psychological function of the individual, or you might expand it to say the psychological function of a cell or the psychological function of any emotional system."

> "The term psychological obviously is inadequate for that description. But it begs a description for the information processing level and the part that makes predictions and produces guidance. And I'm using the term value here in a technical manner."

### The Rocket Guidance Analogy

> "In the rocket analogy, you've got the turn left, turn right problem, how far to turn left, how far to turn right. So this would be equivalent to guidance. This would be like the guidance and the valence put together. It's direction, it's what are you aiming at that would be value."

---

## Objectivity as Biological Adaptation

### The Question

> "If objectivity, the term objectivity is the ability to process information related to the context more accurately and more efficiently, then does this conceptualization provide a case for objectivity as a central characteristic of a biological adaptation?"

> "Is there a basic, better term to replace it? Does this perhaps suggest an objective definition of objectivity, one that applies to all of life instead of depending on the human? What is objectivity in a broader sense?"

---

## Thinking and Emotion Unified

### The Unified Frame

> "All of this puts thinking and emotion into a single frame of reference."

### Humans as Fast Adapters

> "Some organisms adapt their model faster than others. And presently humans can change their model far faster than any other organism, so long as persistence is the goal."

> "They can do that, at least in relation to the context we see on Earth today."

### Simplicity vs. Complexity

> "Who knows, maybe there's microbiotics or something like that, which can survive in an even greater range of contexts... If persistence is the goal, maybe simplicity is better in some contexts than others."

### Thinking and Feeling as Same Function

> "The implicit model concept puts thinking and feeling into a single functional frame of reference. Emotion and thinking simply function to better predict the context. They're not even actually separate functions in this view."

### Proto-Thinking Systems

> "From the frame of reference that puts thinking and feeling into the same function of prediction, then all animals have a proto thinking system. That is to say that humans would then also have a proto thinking system in relation to whatever species may possess a more complex cortex in the future."

### Morphogenetic Basis

> "Each species would be expressing a similar morphogene or set of morphogenes. And morphogenes are the unit of information, let's say, that guide the development or evolution of physiological structure... each species would be expressing a morphogenetic origin code at varying degrees of complexity and or maturation."

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Difference

> "Maybe thinking is just an elaboration of a process that exists in other forms of life and simpler forms of life. Maybe it's just a more complex quantitative difference instead of qualitative difference."

> "Thinking that humans differentiated a thinking system certainly suggests that it's more of a qualitative difference than a quantitative difference. And that view may have utility."

### The Key Implication

> "The implicit model implies, and this is key, that the thinking function simply enhances the function of emotion in a predictive model of context, and that they're really the same function."

### Definition of Thinking

> "From this frame of reference, thinking is simply, and this is a definition, simply the consideration of a broader range of sources of information in the act of prediction."

### Why This is Quantitative

> "That's a quantitative difference because emotion under the definition so far is... the result of a statistical calculation based on sense data and memory of sense data. And so it is considering sources of information. Thinking just adds more sources of information in the consideration that the model considers in its prediction."

> "It does this using all the things we associate with the PFC, like motion, inhibition and all that kind of stuff, but always to the same end of prediction."

---

## The Explicit Model in Research and Coaching

### Error as Evaluation Criterion

> "The principle of assessment is that if persistence is assumed to be the goal, then error in the model can be used to evaluate the model."

### The Goal of Biological Behaviorism

> "For the biological behaviorist, an explicit model is an attempt to simulate an implicit model... the goal of a biological behaviorist is to construct the model that accurately, that shows that you understand the implicit model at work that guides the behavior of the system."

### Unified Conceptualization

> "One advantage of the functional model idea and implicit and explicit models are both functional models, they guide function or behavior, is that the functional model idea conceptualizes both the system being studied and the goal of research itself, or even coaching in the same manner. It's the same concept applies to every situation. That's to define the functional model at work, to use the same concept to understand what you're studying and what you're doing and what you're actually constructing in research, which I think is helpful in a manner that you can assess it, that can potentially be assessed objectively, which is how much error is in this model."

---

## The Evolution of Functional Models

### Phase 1: Functional Differentiation

Patrick describes a hypothetical progression:

1. Simple living system survives in fluid but only in certain temperature range
2. To survive broader temperature fluctuations, it must "differentiate a function" to modulate its processes
3. "It can now do two things instead of one thing"
4. To survive outside liquid, must develop another ability (hibernation, etc.)

> "The idea is that it's stacking on functions and those functions more or less differentiate. They specialize these specialized functions. So functional differentiation."

### The Critical Point

> "A critical point of scalability is reached where the system just can't maintain more differentiated functions. It's reached a critical capacity of complexity, critical mass, let's say, of complexity."

### Phase 2: Fundamental Reorganization

> "In order to continue to adapt, it has to go through a fundamental reorganization, which is not differentiation, it's a simplification. And while the differentiation phase applies to the individual components of the system, that reorganization pertains to the system as a whole."

### Key Characteristics of Phase 2

> "The key here is that the new functions are gained while the old functions are still maintained. So it's not another specialization, it's a redefinition, it's something more basic."

> "I don't know what to call this. It's not integration, it's not the opposite of differentiation, but it's something that works in tandem."

### Connection to Wisdom Traditions

> "Because it works at the level of the greater system, this is what these, you know, this is what the sort of Eastern and holistic traditions, let's call them wisdom traditions or something like that... there is a holism that has come from a lot of the spiritual world that describes something that, the way that at least individuals progress. And I think that there's something about this second phase that is what they're talking about."

### The Efficiency Principle

> "It has to do with more efficiently adapting to the context, using less energy to do more — that's why I'm saying retaining old functions while gaining new functions. There's a simplification that happens. Not more differentiation, more divergence, more complexity."

### The Persona Example

> "I had a different face. Let's just say this is a person. You know, I had. I used to have a different Persona for everyone I would interact with all day. And I learned how to define who I was. I reorganized a fundamental reorganization, And now I am just me. And it takes a lot less energy and it's more effective and I get more of what I want."

### Beyond Differentiation

> "There's something about that. It points at another level for differentiation that the term differentiation as a research term, as a technical term, I don't think captures. I think that there's another phase there. And I think Jan Sapp was onto it, actually. Maybe."

### Computer Science as Source

Patrick discloses: "Some of the speculation here, not all of it, some of this is coming from my experience in computer science because I believe that computer science fundamentally is the science of functional models. It's learning how functional models are organized and evolve."

> "We're just starting to get there because people are starting to use biological terms to describe the most bleeding edge computer science concepts at this point... It's our best understanding, it's our best model of what's written in nature, I think is just the science of software, not the actual software, but the science of software."

### Paradigm Shifts

> "Conceptual systems, when they go through this second phase, it's called a paradigm shift. It's where the individual components that were the concepts in the conceptual system, if you will, were differentiating and increasing in complexity. The disparate models were increasing number. But the old idea, the old organization, the old paradigm, didn't work anymore. And so in the fundamental reorganization, you won't even really see. You'll just see remnants of the old concepts or functions, I guess, in the old system you'll just see traces of them, but they really don't make sense in the new system anymore. It's not even possible to translate. So it's a big shift."

---

## Guidelines for Natural Systems Theory

Patrick describes nine guidelines inferred from Bowen literature (primarily from Kerr's writing on systems thinking):

> "They are a definition for systems thinking."

> "They're basically what goes into a paradigm of emotional systems... an emotional system model would have these characteristics and a more sophisticated model would increase along each one of these."

### The Regression Dimension

Each guideline has a regression form:

- Facts → Preconception and reduction, statistics
- Observations → Partial, incomplete views
- Processes → Static categories (like DSM)
- Reciprocity → Cause and effect thinking

> "More sophisticated models have more of all of these on the left."

---

## The Religion/Darwinian Truth Problem

### The Ninth Concept Question

> "What is the function of religion in a cross species manner? What is religion and how to understand that in a broader sense?"

### The Harris-Peterson Debates

Patrick references four sold-out debates (3,000+ people) between Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson:

> "They were tangling with this problem that a ninth concept of Bowen theory would address, I believe, and that is that how do you reconcile a definition? Well, they were debating on a definition of truth, but really they were operating under the assumption assumptions in line with Bowen's paper on subjectivity, Homo sapiens and science... about the difference between truth and fact."

### Darwinian Truth Defined

> "Darwinian truth is when you have a system of thinking or a model using the terms I've thrown out there, that is factually inaccurate, obviously factually inaccurate, but is more adaptive. And what do you do with that? How do you understand that in the same frame of reference as a scientific theory as any of these other natural systems concepts."

### The Gun Example

> "You treat a gun as if it's always loaded, even when you know for a fact it's not loaded. So that's irrational unless you take it in the broad enough context, which is that the behavior over time is better for survival because you don't kill yourself."

### The Nuance Missing from Fact-Focus

> "This fact, this focus on facts is, I think, misses a nuanced understanding of how species adapt, of what is adaptive and what's not. And this potential for a ninth concept could get at that."

### Science as Adaptation

> "If science, if whatever the science thing is, is adaptive and that it just. There was this crazy phase transition that really took off in the European Enlightenment, let's say, that had its beginnings far earlier. But there are these phases that the human species is going through. Then how do you understand that with other organisms?"

---

## Closing: Theory of Change Restated

> "The theory of change was the elevator pitch is the way a person understands a problem determines what they do to solve it. And the validity of that understanding determines the efficacy of that solution. So the goal in the application of Bowen theory is to assist a person making their model of the problem or problems as accurate as possible."

> "The validity points to objectivity and how to understand this in a broader context. And that's what the concept was for."

Patrick closes seeking critique:

> "I'm looking for critique. I want to know where this is wrong. A misrepresentation of any theoretical concepts, misrepresentation of concepts and accepted concepts and evolution. All of this stuff."

## Key Conceptual Extractions for Synthesis

### 1. The Implicit/Explicit Model Distinction

- **Explicit model**: What a person says they believe/know
- **Implicit model**: What their behavior actually reveals
- The two may diverge significantly
- The goal of coaching/research is to infer the implicit model

### 2. The Emotional System IS the Implicit Model

This is a major theoretical claim: Bowen's "emotional system" can be understood as the family's implicit predictive model.

### 3. Error as the Fundamental Variable

- All models predict with error
- The struggle of life = prediction error
- Error accumulates moment to moment
- Objectivity = minimizing prediction error

### 4. Emotion = Action Directed by Prediction

- Emotion is the physical outcome of the model's statistical best guess
- Model operates at information level; emotion at physical level
- Emotion is always partially appropriate (or the organism wouldn't have survived)

### 5. Value = Guidance

- Value is the product of the implicit model
- Valence (desirable/undesirable) + intensity
- An emergent ethic built into biology

### 6. Thinking = Extended Prediction

- Thinking and emotion are the same function at different complexity levels
- Thinking = considering more sources of information in prediction
- Quantitative difference, not necessarily qualitative

### 7. The Bleeding Effect

- Changes to explicit models can change implicit models
- This is why theory development matters more than technique
- Seeing a triangle can reduce automatic reactivity within it

### 8. Two Phases of Adaptation

- **Phase 1**: Functional differentiation (adding specialized functions)
- **Phase 2**: Fundamental reorganization/simplification at system level
- Phase 2 is not more differentiation — it's something else working in tandem
- May correspond to what wisdom traditions describe

### 9. Cross-Species Definitions

The concept enables cross-species definitions of:
- Objectivity (ability to predict context with minimal error)
- Thinking (considering broader range of information in prediction)
- Religion (function of Darwinian truth — models that are factually wrong but adaptive)

### 10. The Missing Family Simulator

Bowen theory describes WHAT the family emotional system does, not HOW it accomplishes this. A true explicit model would be an agent-based simulation where Bowen concepts emerge from individual scripts.

## Connections to Decision Graph / Couzin Paper

| Stinson Concept | Decision Graph / Couzin Parallel |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Implicit model guides behavior automatically | Neural model guides spatial decisions automatically |
| Explicit model = stated theory | Stated rationale for decision |
| Error in prediction | Critical threshold where small differences tip decisions |
| Emotion = physical outcome of prediction | Movement = physical outcome of neural computation |
| Thinking = more information sources | Deliberation before commitment to one option |
| The ~30% who don't show Phase 2 reorganization | The ~30% who go directly to default mechanism |
| Functional differentiation → reorganization | Sequential bifurcation → final selection |
| Context (internal + external) | Egocentric geometry (relationship to options) |
| Cross-species objectivity | Cross-taxa geometric principles |
| Family as collective implicit model | Collective decision-making following same rules as neural |

### The Deep Connection

**Stinson**: The implicit model makes statistical predictions and error is the fundamental struggle.

**Couzin**: The neural system averages options, then bifurcates at critical thresholds, with individual variation in tuning.

**Synthesis hint**: The "implicit behavioral model" we're building is the person's characteristic pattern of bifurcation — their default tuning (ν), their threshold sensitivity, their sequence of mechanism selection under anxiety.
