## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**Conflict** refers to an anxiety-binding mechanism in relationships characterized by overt tension, disagreement, criticism, and blame between two people. In conflict, each spouse "fights for an equal share of the common self and neither gives in to the other."

Conflict is one of the three primary mechanisms (along with distance and dysfunction in one spouse) that spouses use to manage the intensity of emotional fusion in marriage. It is NOT a cause of relationship problems - it is evidence of the underlying undifferentiation and a mechanism for binding the anxiety generated by that fusion.

**Key characteristics:**
- Conflict maintains emotional ENGAGEMENT while managing fusion anxiety
- In conflict, neither person "gives in" to the other - both maintain fighting positions
- Conflict can be chronic and cyclical, with repetitive escalation patterns
- Conflict binds family anxiety in the marital relationship specifically
- Conflict can be the "negative side" of a triangle - allowing other sides to remain positive

**A shift toward MORE conflict** is indicated by:
- More overt disagreement, criticism, counterattacking
- Neither person willing to accommodate to reduce tension
- Escalating cycles of accusation and defense
- More preoccupation with what the other thinks, says, does
- Anxiety driving both toward fighting rather than adapting or distancing

**A shift toward LESS conflict** is indicated by:
- Movement toward one person adapting (but may → dysfunction in adapter)
- Movement toward distance (but may → symptoms from isolation)
- Third person absorbing tension (but may → triangle-related symptoms)
- One person achieving more differentiation (actual resolution)

## Key Discriminators

### What Conflict IS (positive definition)

1. **Conflict is an anxiety-binding mechanism** - One of the mechanisms spouses use to control the intensity of ego fusion; binds anxiety within the relationship (FTiCP9-12, FE6-19)

2. **In conflict, neither gives in** - Each fights for "equal share of common self"; distinguishes conflict from adaptive pattern (FTiCP9-12)

3. **Conflict can preserve marriages** - Conflictual marriages can be enduring because of the emotional energy investment; keeps partners engaged (FTiCP9-17)

4. **Conflict can be the "negative side" of a triangle** - One relationship being conflictual allows other sides to remain calm and harmonious (FE6-19, FE6-21)

5. **Conflict cycles are predictable** - Feeling criticized → getting defensive → counterattacking; these cycles repeat (FE5-21)

6. **Conflict is intensified by anxiety** - Higher anxiety = more conflict; lower anxiety = conflict may subside (FE6-9)

7. **Conflict is mutually reinforcing** - Each person's reactivity triggers more reactivity in the other; neither is "cause" (FE6-21)

8. **Conflict can be acted out between different people** - Original conflict (e.g., marital) may be "acted out" between others (e.g., parent-child, siblings) via triangles (FE6-21, FE6-38)

### What Conflict is NOT (negative definition)

1. **Conflict is NOT the cause of problems** - Conflict is evidence of undifferentiation and anxiety, not a cause; marital conflict does not cause child symptoms (FTiCP9-15, FE7-22)

2. **Conflict is NOT absence of emotional investment** - Conflictual couples may have MORE emotional investment than calm ones; energy just directed negatively (FTiCP9-17)

3. **Conflict resolution is NOT always positive** - When conflict is "resolved" by one person adapting, dysfunction may develop in the adapter; distance can follow (FTiCP9-12)

4. **Conflict is NOT unique to poorly differentiated systems** - Any relationship under sufficient stress can develop conflict; intensity varies with differentiation (FE6-34)

5. **Absence of conflict is NOT evidence of healthy relationship** - Calm relationship may be maintained at cost of conflict elsewhere in triangle (FE6-21)

6. **Conflict is NOT caused by one person** - Both contribute; neither is "victimizer" though it may appear that way (FE6-106)

## Observable Speech/Behavior Markers for Classification

### Markers of CONFLICT Present or Increasing

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Criticism-Defense Cycles** | One criticizes → other defends → first counterattacks → escalation | FE5-21 |
| **Blame Language** | "You always...", "You never...", "If you would just..." | FE6-79, FE6-117 |
| **Neither Accommodating** | Both maintain position; neither "gives in" | FTiCP9-12 |
| **Preoccupation with Other** | Extensive thinking time about other's faults, deficits | FTiCP9-17 |
| **Diagnosing/Labeling Other** | Calling other "cold," "unfeeling," "selfish," "needy" | FE6-79, FE6-83 |
| **Recruiting Allies** | Telling others about partner's faults; seeking sympathy | FE6-17, FE6-79 |
| **Defending Position** | "If you are not with me, you are against me" | FE6-123 |
| **Accusing/Indicting** | Emotional investment shifted to negative accusations | FTiCP9-17 |

### Markers of CONFLICT Decreasing or Shifting

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **One Person Adapting** | "Giving in" to reduce tension; avoiding "unpleasant subjects" | FE6-77, FE6-78 |
| **Distance Increasing** | Avoiding bringing up issues; emotional insulation | FE6-77, FE6-81 |
| **Third Person Involvement** | Talking to mother/friend about spouse instead of to spouse | FE6-79, FE6-80 |
| **Shifting to Child** | Parents focus on child's problems; marital tension obscured | FE6-92 |
| **Symptom Focus** | Focus shifts to one person's illness, drinking, etc. | FE6-82 |
| **Detriangling Comments** | Neutral remarks that don't take sides | FE6-100, FE6-108 |

## Conflict's Relationship to Triangles

Conflict is deeply intertwined with triangle dynamics:

| Triangle Pattern | Conflict Role | Source |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| **One negative side** | At moderate anxiety, conflict concentrated in one relationship; other two sides calm | FE6-19, FE6-21 |
| **Acting out marital tension** | Father-daughter conflict may "act out" unresolved marital tension | FE6-21 |
| **Outsider position** | In high anxiety, conflict makes inside position uncomfortable; outsider position desired | FE6-26 |
| **Interlocking triangles** | Conflict in one triangle can spread to others or shift location | FE6-38, FE6-40 |
| **Third person recruited** | Uncomfortable insider recruits outsider via complaints; creates new conflict location | FE6-17, FE6-26 |
| **Detriangling reduces conflict** | Emotionally neutral third person allows twosome to resolve conflict | FE6-71, FE6-85 |

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

FE Ch 6 (Triangles), FE Ch 7 (Nuclear Family), FE Ch 5 (Anxiety), and FTiCP Ch 9 agree:

1. **Conflict as anxiety-binding mechanism** - One of the primary ways to manage fusion intensity (FTiCP9-12, FE6-19)
2. **Neither person "causes" conflict** - Mutual reinforcement; both contribute (FE6-106, FE9-6)
3. **Conflict can shift location in system** - Via triangles, conflict moves between relationships (FE6-21, FE6-38)
4. **Conflict does not cause child symptoms** - This is explicit rebuttal of common assumption (FTiCP9-15)
5. **Intensity tracks anxiety** - Higher anxiety = more intense conflict (FE6-9, FE6-34)
6. **Conflict maintains engagement** - Different from distance; keeps emotional investment active (FTiCP9-17)

### Tensions/Nuances Between Sources

1. **FE Ch 6 emphasizes triangle context** - Conflict understood primarily as triangle dynamic
2. **FTiCP Ch 9 lists conflict as one of three marital mechanisms** - Alongside dysfunction in spouse and transmission to children
3. **FE Ch 5 emphasizes anxiety-driven escalation** - The internal experience of conflict cycles

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **Intensity gradation** - How to distinguish mild disagreement from "conflict" as SARF term? Sources don't define threshold

2. **Conflict vs criticism** - Is one critical remark "conflict"? Or does it require sustained pattern?

3. **Productive conflict** - Is there such a thing in Bowen Theory? Sources suggest conflict is always anxiety-driven

4. **Conflict in high-differentiation systems** - Sources say any system can develop conflict under stress; how is it different at high differentiation?

5. **Concurrent with other mechanisms** - Can conflict and distance coexist? Sources suggest they alternate

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Conflict as anxiety-binding mechanism | HIGH | Explicit in FTiCP9-12, FE6-19 |
| Neither gives in (distinguisher) | HIGH | Explicit in FTiCP9-12 |
| Conflict can shift via triangles | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-21, FE6-38 |
| Conflict doesn't cause child symptoms | HIGH | Explicit in FTiCP9-15 |
| Observable speech markers | MEDIUM | Derived from examples; not explicit lists |
| Intensity threshold | LOW | Not defined in sources |

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to Conflict |
|------|-------------------------|
| **Functioning (F)** | Conflict can impair functioning if chronic; but can also preserve F by binding anxiety |
| **Anxiety (A)** | Conflict intensified by A; conflict binds A |
| **Symptom (S)** | Conflict can prevent S in conflicting pair; may shift S to third party |
| **Distance** | Alternative to conflict; may follow when conflict "fails" |
| **Cutoff** | Extreme distance after unresolved conflict |
| **Overfunctioning** | Conflict different from over/under pattern (neither gives in) |
| **Underfunctioning** | Conflict different from over/under pattern (neither gives in) |
| **Projection** | Alternative mechanism; parents focus on child instead of conflict |
| **Inside/Outside** | Triangle positions; conflict often in "inside" pair or between insider and outsider |
| **DefinedSelf** | Higher differentiation → less conflict or less intense conflict |

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Should we distinguish "conflict" (sustained pattern) from "conflictual moment" (episode)?
2. Is conflict always negative in SARF coding, or can it be neutral (just binding anxiety)?
3. Should we track conflict location (marital, parent-child, sibling) separately?
4. How do we code when conflict shifts to a new relationship?
5. What's the relationship between conflict and "criticism"?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]
