## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**Anxiety (A)** refers to the response of an organism to a threat, real or imagined. It is a process assumed to be present in all living things. The key distinction is between **acute anxiety** (response to real threats, time-limited, typically managed successfully) and **chronic anxiety** (response to imagined threats, not time-limited, often exceeds adaptive capacity).

**Chronic anxiety** is the principal generator of symptoms and dysfunction. It is:
- Generated more by people's *reactions to disturbances in relationship balance* than by reactions to specific events
- "Infectious" - transmitted between people without thinking; can "infect" an entire family
- Inversely related to differentiation - lower differentiation = higher average chronic anxiety
- The "fuel" that intensifies all anxiety-binding mechanisms (conflict, distance, overfunctioning, underfunctioning, projection)

**A shift UP (anxiety increasing)** is indicated by:
- Movement toward greater emotional reactivity
- Greater need for emotional contact/closeness OR greater need for distance/insulation
- Less tolerance of differences in others
- More feeling of being overloaded, overwhelmed, isolated
- More pressure to adapt/accommodate to relieve others' anxiety
- More focus on what others think, feel, say, do
- More preoccupation with whether one is approved, accepted, rejected
- Feelings of not getting enough or giving enough in relationships

**A shift DOWN (anxiety decreasing)** is indicated by:
- Movement toward greater emotional autonomy
- Ability to maintain comfortable contact with emotionally significant others despite stress
- Greater tolerance for differences
- Less reactivity to praise, criticism, or perceived slights
- More ability to focus on self rather than on changing others
- Less need for emotional reinforcement from relationships

## Key Discriminators

### What Anxiety IS (positive definition)

1. **Anxiety is the organism's response to threat, real or imagined** - Manifested along a continuum from hyperactivity (extreme = behavioral frenzy) to hypoactivity (extreme = behavioral paralysis) (FE5-1, FE5-2)

2. **Chronic anxiety is fed by fear of what MIGHT be; acute anxiety by fear of what IS** - This is a core distinction: chronic = imagined threats; acute = real threats (FE5-3)

3. **Chronic anxiety is generated more by REACTIONS to disturbance than by the event itself** - Once the balance of a relationship system is disturbed, people's reactions to one another propagate anxiety more than reactions to the triggering event (FE5-4, FE5-5)

4. **Anxiety is "infectious" - transmitted and absorbed without thinking** - A child tends to develop a baseline level of chronic anxiety close to what is average for his nuclear family (FE5-9, FE5-10)

5. **Average chronic anxiety parallels basic differentiation** - The lower the level of basic differentiation, the higher the average level of chronic anxiety (FE5-7)

6. **Anxiety varies in the same person over time** - Not fixed; fluctuates with relationship process and life events (FE5-6)

7. **Anxiety escalates through chain reactions** - One person's anxiety "infects" another, reactions lead to chain reactions, anxiety feeds on anxiety (FE5-23, FE5-24)

### What Anxiety is NOT (negative definition)

1. **Anxiety is NOT always conscious** - Most anxiety is not conscious; it manifests even at cellular level (FE3-note13)

2. **Anxiety is NOT solely caused by external events** - Principal generators are people's reactions to disturbances in relationship balance, not the events themselves (FE5-4)

3. **Anxiety reduction through distance is NOT differentiation** - Using distance, denial, or projection to relieve anxiety may lower it in oneself but raise it in others (FE5-27)

4. **Acute anxiety is NOT chronic anxiety** - Acute is response to real threats, time-limited; chronic is response to imagined threats, ongoing (FE5-3)

5. **High activity is NOT the same as high anxiety** - Many seemingly inactive, low-response people are called "nonreactive" when their inactivity is a way of managing high emotional reactivity (FE5-note1)

6. **Therapy-based anxiety reduction is NOT the same as differentiation** - Symptom exchanges between family members show that basic chronic anxiety hasn't changed, just where it's bound (FE5-29)

## Observable Speech/Behavior Markers for Classification

### Markers of A Shift UP (Anxiety Increasing)

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Reactivity Increase** | More intense emotional, feeling, subjective responses; less ability to think objectively | FE5-11, FE5-13 |

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

All four sources (FE Ch 5, FE Ch 3, FE Ch 7, Havstad) agree on:

1. **Anxiety is a trackable variable** - It shifts with relationship system shifts; can be documented in time (H-3, H-4)
2. **Chronic vs. acute distinction** - Chronic is the problematic form; response to imagined threats (FE5-3)
3. **Relationship-generated** - Anxiety is spawned primarily by relationship process, not external events (FE5-4, FE3-25)
4. **Inversely related to differentiation** - Lower differentiation = higher chronic anxiety (FE5-7, FE3-23)
5. **Binding mechanisms** - Distance, conflict, overfunctioning-underfunctioning, projection all bind anxiety (FE5-15, FE7-1)
6. **Infectious nature** - Anxiety transmits between people; "rubs off" without thinking (FE5-9, FE5-23)

### Tensions/Nuances Between Sources

1. **Havstad operationalizes A as research variable** - Tracks shifts in time; FE chapters treat it more descriptively
2. **FE Ch 5 focuses on individual anxiety management** - FE Ch 7 focuses on nuclear family patterns that bind it
3. **FE Ch 3 emphasizes togetherness force connection** - Links anxiety to the fundamental individuality-togetherness balance

---

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **How quickly can anxiety shift be detected in speech?** - Sources describe shifts over days to months but don't specify minimum observable window for transcript classification

2. **What are objective physiological markers?** - Sources mention cellular/immune system involvement but don't provide operational measures (FE5-2, FE5-28)

3. **Self-report reliability** - Can people accurately report their own anxiety level? Sources suggest the more anxious, the less insight (FE5-12)

4. **Distinguishing acute from chronic in real-time** - Both present similarly in the moment; chronic is defined by pattern over time

---

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Acute vs chronic distinction | HIGH | Explicit in FE5-3 |
| Anxiety generated by relationship process | HIGH | Explicit in FE5-4, FE5-5, multiple sources |
| Inversely related to differentiation | HIGH | Explicit in FE5-7, FE3-23 |
| "Infectious" transmission between people | HIGH | Explicit in FE5-9, FE5-23 |
| Observable speech markers | MEDIUM | Derived from descriptions; not explicitly listed for classification |
| Detection window for transcript analysis | LOW | Sources don't address observability window |

---

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to Anxiety |
|------|------------------------|
| **Functioning (F)** | Inversely related; rising A typically triggers F shift DOWN |
| **Symptom (S)** | A exceeding adaptive capacity triggers symptom development |
| **Conflict** | One mechanism that binds A; anxiety drives conflict intensity |
| **Distance** | Another binding mechanism; provides emotional insulation from A |
| **Cutoff** | Extreme distance to manage A; does not resolve underlying A |
| **Overfunctioning** | Anxiety binding mechanism; intensified by rising A |
| **Underfunctioning** | Anxiety binding mechanism; intensified by rising A |
| **Projection** | Parental anxiety focused on child; transmits A across generations |
| **Inside/Outside** | Triangle positions shift with A; high A = more triangle movement |
| **DefinedSelf** | Acts to reduce system A; differentiation reduces chronic A |

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Is the acute/chronic distinction operationally useful for SARF classification?
2. Should we track A shift direction (UP/DOWN) or just presence of anxiety markers?
3. How do we handle anxiety that is "bound" vs "expressed"?
4. Are there anxiety speech markers I missed from clinical practice?
5. Should anxiety-binding mechanisms (conflict, distance, etc.) be coded separately from A itself?
6. Does the "infectious" nature of anxiety require tracking multiple people's A simultaneously?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]
