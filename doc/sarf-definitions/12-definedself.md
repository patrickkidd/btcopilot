---

## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**DefinedSelf** refers to a statement or action that expresses one's own position, beliefs, values, or intentions without attempting to change or control the other person. It is a manifestation of differentiation - the capacity to maintain emotional autonomy while remaining in contact with others.

An I-position or "defined self" statement is characterized by:
- Speaking for SELF rather than speaking for or about the other
- Expressing one's own position without attacking or defending
- Not requiring the other to change or agree
- Tolerating the anxiety of taking a position
- Maintaining contact while expressing difference

**Key characteristics:**
- Based on principle rather than feeling/reactivity
- Requires ability to distinguish thinking from feeling
- Does not require validation from others
- Can be maintained under emotional pressure
- Creates temporary anxiety in the system but long-term reduction
- Distinguished from "pseudo-self" positions (borrowed beliefs)

**Observable markers of DEFINEDSELF:**
- "I think...", "I believe...", "I will...", "I won't..."
- Stating position without blaming or criticizing
- Not defending position excessively
- Tolerating disagreement without anxiety escalation
- Actions consistent with stated position
- Not changing position to relieve anxiety or get approval

## Key Discriminators

### What DefinedSelf IS (positive definition)

1. **DefinedSelf = expressing one's own position** - "I" statements about self, not "you" statements about other (FE6-108, FE6-127)

2. **DefinedSelf is based on principle** - "Functioning based on principle requires a tolerance of anxiety" (FE5-34)

3. **DefinedSelf tolerates disagreement** - Does not require other to agree or validate (FE3-8, FE3-9)

4. **DefinedSelf maintains contact** - Expresses position while staying in relationship, not withdrawing (FE9-22)

5. **DefinedSelf is action-congruent** - "Actions have more impact than words" (FE6-127)

6. **DefinedSelf creates temporary anxiety** - Differentiating moves initially raise system anxiety; long-term benefit (FE5-32)

7. **DefinedSelf requires distinguishing thinking from feeling** - Recognizing difference between feeling response and thinking response (FE5-33)

### What DefinedSelf is NOT (negative definition)

1. **DefinedSelf is NOT attacking the other** - Not "You always..." or "You make me..." (FE6-108)

2. **DefinedSelf is NOT defending self excessively** - Not getting defensive when challenged (FE5-21)

3. **DefinedSelf is NOT declaring independence** - Not breaking away; staying in contact (FE9-22)

4. **DefinedSelf is NOT pseudo-self** - Not borrowed beliefs/values adopted to gain approval (FE4-82)

5. **DefinedSelf is NOT changing to reduce anxiety** - Not caving to relieve pressure of the moment (FE5-25)

6. **DefinedSelf is NOT ignoring relationship** - Not using differentiation as excuse to avoid connection

## Observable Speech/Behavior Markers for Classification

### Markers of DEFINEDSELF Statement

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **I-Statements** | "I think...", "I believe...", "I'm going to...", "I won't..." | FE6-108 |
| **Non-Blaming** | Position stated without criticism of other | FE6-108 |
| **Non-Defensive** | Not over-explaining or justifying when challenged | FE5-34 |
| **Tolerates Disagreement** | Doesn't escalate when other disagrees | FE3-9 |
| **Action Congruent** | Actions match stated position | FE6-127 |
| **Calm Under Pressure** | Maintains position when anxiety rises | FE5-34 |
| **Principle-Based Language** | "Based on what I believe...", "My values are..." | FE5-34 |
| **Self-Focus** | Focus on own behavior, not on changing other | FE5-31 |

### Markers of NON-DefinedSelf (Reactive/Fused)

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **You-Statements** | "You always...", "You make me...", "Why do you..." | FE6-117 |
| **Blame/Criticism** | Attacking other's position or character | FE5-21 |
| **Defensive Escalation** | Getting increasingly defensive when challenged | FE5-21 |
| **Position Shifting** | Changing position to relieve anxiety or gain approval | FE5-25 |
| **Requiring Agreement** | "Don't you think...?", "You have to admit..." | FE4-82 |
| **Withdrawal** | Cutting off contact rather than maintaining position | FE9-22 |
| **Feeling-Based** | "I feel that you..." (actually about other, not self) | FE5-33 |

## DefinedSelf vs Pseudo-Self

A critical distinction:

| DefinedSelf (Solid/Basic) | Pseudo-Self (Borrowed/Functional) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Based on own thinking through issues | Based on borrowed beliefs from others |
| Consistent under pressure | Changes under pressure |
| Not for trade in relationships | Can be traded to gain approval |
| Maintained regardless of others' reactions | Shifts based on others' reactions |
| Product of differentiation | Product of fusion |

**NOTE**: High functional self can look like differentiation but collapses under sufficient stress. Solid self is maintained.

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

FE Ch 4, FE Ch 5, FE Ch 6, and FE Ch 9 agree:

1. **Differentiation = maintaining self in contact** - Not withdrawal; staying engaged (FE9-22)
2. **Principle-based vs feeling-based** - Functioning on principle requires anxiety tolerance (FE5-34)
3. **Actions more powerful than words** - Defined positions must be acted on (FE6-127)
4. **Distinguishing thinking from feeling** - Core skill for differentiation (FE5-33)
5. **Temporary anxiety increase** - Differentiating moves raise anxiety initially (FE5-32)

### Terms from Sources

Different sources use different terms:
- **Differentiation of self** (general concept)
- **I-position** (statement form)
- **Defined self** (state of being)
- **Solid self** (vs pseudo-self)
- **Basic self** (vs functional self)

---

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **Authenticity assessment** - How distinguish true defined self from well-articulated pseudo-self?

2. **Single statement vs pattern** - Does one I-statement count, or need pattern?

3. **Intensity requirement** - Does it count if said calmly vs under pressure?

4. **Outcome irrelevance** - Sources say outcome doesn't determine if it was defined self; process matters

5. **Partial definitions** - Can someone be defined in one area and not others?

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| I-statements = defined self | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-108 |
| Principle-based vs feeling-based | HIGH | Explicit in FE5-33, FE5-34 |
| Maintaining contact | HIGH | Explicit in FE9-22 |
| Actions over words | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-127 |
| Observable markers | MEDIUM | Derived from descriptions |
| Authenticity assessment | LOW | Not operationally defined |

---

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to DefinedSelf |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Functioning (F)** | DefinedSelf tends to raise F in long-term |
| **Anxiety (A)** | DefinedSelf requires tolerating A; reduces chronic A |
| **Symptom (S)** | Higher differentiation → lower S vulnerability |
| **Conflict** | DefinedSelf can resolve or prevent conflict |
| **Distance** | DefinedSelf ≠ distance; maintains contact |
| **Cutoff** | DefinedSelf ≠ cutoff; growing away, not breaking away |
| **Overfunctioning** | Higher differentiation → less over/underfunctioning |
| **Underfunctioning** | Higher differentiation → less over/underfunctioning |
| **Projection** | Higher differentiation → less projection |
| **Inside/Outside** | Higher differentiation → comfortable in any position |

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Should we code every I-statement as DefinedSelf, or only substantive position statements?
2. How do we distinguish authentic defined self from well-rehearsed pseudo-self?
3. Should we track the system response to DefinedSelf statements?
4. Is DefinedSelf coded for the speaker or the statement?
5. How do we handle statements that are partially defined self (good form but anxious delivery)?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]
