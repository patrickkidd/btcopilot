**SARF Variable** | **Priority: 2 - Triangle Position** | **Status: COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT - Awaiting Calibration**

## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**Inside** refers to one of two positions in a triangle - the position of being "in" the emotionally significant relationship at a given moment. At calm anxiety levels, the inside position is typically comfortable and desired. At high anxiety, the inside position becomes uncomfortable, and people in inside positions seek to move outside.

A triangle consists of two "insiders" who are in closer emotional contact with each other, and one "outsider" who is at greater emotional distance. These positions are fluid and shift with anxiety.

**Key characteristics:**
- Inside = closer emotional contact with another person in the triangle
- At low anxiety: inside position is comfortable, desired
- At high anxiety: inside position becomes uncomfortable
- When uncomfortable: insider tries to recruit outsider OR move outside
- Inside position can be positive (close, harmonious) or negative (conflict)
- The two inside positions are NOT equivalent - one often more comfortable than other

**Observable markers of INSIDE position:**
- Being in direct emotional engagement with another person
- Direct communication (rather than talking through third party)
- Feeling "too close" or "crowded" when anxious
- Seeking someone to talk to about the other insider
- Being the topic of conversation between the other two
- Attempting to recruit outsider into the relationship

## Key Discriminators

### What INSIDE IS (positive definition)

1. **Inside = closer emotional contact** - Two people are "comfortably close (the insiders)" while third is at greater distance (FE6-13)

2. **Inside positions are NOT equivalent** - "The discomfort is felt far more by one person than the other" (FE6-15)

3. **Inside position becomes uncomfortable at high anxiety** - What was comfortable closeness becomes "too close" (FE6-17, FE6-26)

4. **Uncomfortable insider triangles** - "Uncomfortable insider (A) can pull the outsider (C) into the situation through complaints" (FE6-17)

5. **Inside can be positive or negative** - One side of triangle can be conflictual while other sides calm; conflict is inside but negative (FE6-19)

6. **Inside position shifts with anxiety** - Same person may be inside in one moment, outside in next (FE6-24)

### What INSIDE is NOT (negative definition)

1. **Inside is NOT static** - Positions are fluid, shift with anxiety and over time (FE6-24)

2. **Inside is NOT always desirable** - At high anxiety, outside position may be preferred (FE6-26)

3. **Inside is NOT the same as fusion** - Though more fused relationships tend toward more uncomfortable inside positions

4. **Both insiders are NOT equally comfortable** - Asymmetric experience is typical (FE6-15)

## Observable Speech/Behavior Markers for Classification

### Markers of INSIDE Position

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Direct Engagement** | Speaking directly to/about the other person; emotional intensity | FE6-13 |
| **Closeness Language** | "We're so close"; "We're always together" | FE6-13 |
| **Discomfort at High Anxiety** | "I feel crowded"; "I can't breathe"; "I need space" | FE6-22 |
| **Triangling Attempts** | Complaining to outsider about other insider; recruiting | FE6-17 |
| **Being Topic** | Being discussed by the other two (even if not present) | FE6-24 |
| **Conflict Involvement** | Direct conflict with other insider (negative inside) | FE6-19 |

### Markers of Movement FROM Inside to Outside

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Distancing** | Pulling away from other insider; reduced engagement | FE6-26 |
| **Complaining to Third** | Talking to outsider about the relationship problem | FE6-17 |
| **Maneuvering** | Working to put self in outside position | FE6-26 |
| **Withdrawal** | Emotional or physical withdrawal from intense twosome | FE6-77 |

---

## Inside-Outside Dynamics

The triangle always has two inside positions and one outside position:

| Anxiety Level | Inside Experience | Typical Movement |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| LOW | Comfortable; closeness feels good | Stable; little movement |
| MODERATE | Some discomfort; one insider less comfortable | May try to involve outsider |
| HIGH | Uncomfortable; closeness feels threatening | Fight to move outside |

**At high anxiety**: "The outside position is the most comfortable and desired" (FE6-26). People fight to get out of the uncomfortable inside position.

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

FE Ch 6 (Triangles) is the primary source for inside/outside positions:

1. **Two insiders, one outsider** - Basic triangle structure (FE6-13)
2. **Asymmetric comfort** - One insider less comfortable (FE6-15)
3. **Anxiety shifts positions** - Higher anxiety = more movement (FE6-26)
4. **Triangling as position change** - Recruiting outsider changes structure (FE6-17)
5. **Conflict as inside position** - Negative side of triangle = inside (FE6-19)

---

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **Position identification in transcripts** - How to determine who is inside vs outside from speech alone?

2. **Multiple triangles** - Person can be inside in one triangle, outside in another simultaneously

3. **Position stability** - How long must someone be "in" to code as inside? Positions shift rapidly.

4. **Intensity gradation** - Degrees of "inside-ness"? Sources describe as binary.

5. **Self-report reliability** - Can people accurately identify their own position?

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Two insiders, one outsider | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-13 |
| Asymmetric comfort | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-15 |
| Anxiety shifts positions | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-26 |
| Observable markers | MEDIUM | Derived from examples |
| Position identification method | LOW | Not operationally defined |

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to Inside |
|------|------------------------|
| **Functioning (F)** | Inside position can impair F if uncomfortable |
| **Anxiety (A)** | Higher A → inside becomes uncomfortable |
| **Symptom (S)** | Chronic uncomfortable inside → S vulnerability |
| **Conflict** | Conflict = negative inside position |
| **Distance** | Distance = movement toward outside |
| **Cutoff** | Cutoff = permanent outside |
| **Overfunctioning** | Often inside position with underfunctioner |
| **Underfunctioning** | Often inside position with overfunctioner |
| **Projection** | Projected-on child = inside with projecting parent |
| **Outside** | COMPLEMENTARY - cannot exist without each other |
| **DefinedSelf** | Higher differentiation → comfortable in any position |

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Should we track inside/outside as states or as shifts?
2. How do we identify position from transcript alone?
3. Should we track multiple triangles simultaneously?
4. Is inside always paired with specific outside person?
5. How do we handle rapid position shifts within a session?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]
