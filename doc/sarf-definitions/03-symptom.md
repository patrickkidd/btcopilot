## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**Symptom (S)** refers to evidence of dysfunction in the emotional system - any impairment in physical, emotional, or social functioning that emerges when the harmonious balance of relationships within a person or their relationship network is disturbed. All clinical symptoms are linked to the emotional system.

Symptoms are understood as outcomes of relationship process, not as isolated individual pathology. They indicate that a balance has been disturbed - a balance that operates within the individual AND within their central relationship network.

**A shift to SYMPTOMATIC** is indicated by:
- Development of physical illness (medical disorders)
- Development of emotional illness (psychiatric disorders)
- Development of social dysfunction (conduct/criminal disorders)
- Movement into dysfunction in ANY category when system balance is disturbed

**Symptom ONSET or WORSENING** occurs when:
- Chronic anxiety exceeds adaptive capacity
- Relationship balance is disturbed (by addition or loss)
- The person making most adjustments absorbs disproportionate anxiety
- A previously bound system becomes disturbed

**Symptom RELIEF** occurs when:
- Anxiety decreases in the emotional field
- Functional level of differentiation increases (support system, togetherness)
- Basic level of differentiation increases (in self or connected others)
- A new relationship or distance provides emotional insulation

## Key Discriminators

### What Symptom IS (positive definition)

1. **Symptom = evidence of disturbance in system balance** - Clinical symptoms indicate that a "yet poorly understood balance has somehow been disturbed" (FE9-3)

2. **Symptoms exist on a continuum of severity** - From mild, transient symptoms that come and go with anxiety fluctuation, to severe chronic symptoms (FE7-17, FTiCP9-14)

3. **Three categories of symptom are interchangeable** - Physical, emotional, and social symptoms are generated by the SAME patterns of emotional functioning; the patterns don't cause different categories (FE7-1, FE9-7)

4. **The person making most adjustments is most prone to symptoms** - Whether overfunctioning (doing too much) or underfunctioning (depending too much), whoever absorbs most anxiety is most vulnerable (FE7-9, FE7-10)

5. **Symptoms can be relieved by togetherness process** - A comfortable relationship can make symptoms disappear; distance/insulation can also relieve symptoms (FE9-2)

6. **Symptoms can stabilize a system** - Chronic symptoms may absorb family anxiety and protect others from dysfunction (FE7-2, FE9-11)

7. **Symptom development parallels relationship process intensity** - Severity tends to parallel the intensity of the relationship process that creates it (FE7-17)

8. **Symptoms can shift location in family** - When one person's symptoms resolve, another may develop them; symptoms "exchange" within family systems (FE9-11, FE5-28)

### What Symptom is NOT (negative definition)

1. **Symptom is NOT caused by one factor** - Not by specific pathogen, defect, or event alone; emerges from interplay of multiple factors at multiple levels (FE9-4)

2. **Symptom is NOT caused by family process** - Family process is an IMPORTANT INFLUENCE but does not CAUSE symptoms; all components of emotional system influence whether problem "flowers" (FE9-8)

3. **Symptom relief is NOT resolution of underlying process** - Symptoms may disappear via togetherness or distance without basic differentiation changing; vulnerability remains (FE9-2)

4. **Symptom location is NOT random** - Where symptom develops (which person, which category) is determined by patterns of emotional functioning predominant in that family (FE7-3)

5. **The "patient" is NOT the cause of family distress** - Just as family is not cause of patient's distress; mutual reinforcement, not linear causation (FE9-6)

6. **Categories (physical, emotional, social) are NOT qualitatively different** - Differences are quantitative, not qualitative; same processes underlie all categories (FE7-17, FE9-7)

## Observable Speech/Behavior Markers for Classification

### Markers of Symptom DEVELOPMENT or WORSENING

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Physical Symptoms** | Illness flare-up, medical diagnosis, hospitalization, new health complaints | FE9-16, FE9-17 |
| **Emotional Symptoms** | Depression, anxiety attacks, phobias, psychotic episodes, feeling "out of control" | FE9-15, FE7-14 |
| **Social Symptoms** | Acting out, irresponsible behavior, substance abuse, delinquency, affairs | FE7-21, FE7-22 |
| **Functional Impairment** | Cannot work, cannot maintain relationships, cannot perform daily tasks | FE9-19, FTiCP9-6 |
| **Help-Seeking** | Entering therapy, hospitalization, diagnosis sought | FE9-24 |
| **Chronicity Markers** | Long-term dependence on treatment, medication, institutions | FE7-18, FE9-21 |

### Markers of Symptom RELIEF or IMPROVEMENT

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Functional Improvement** | Return to work, improved performance, restoration of daily function | FE9-2 |
| **Relationship Change** | New supportive relationship, reduced conflict, restored emotional contact | FE9-2, FE9-25 |
| **Reduced Focus** | Less preoccupation with symptoms, less family focus on symptomatic one | FE9-23 |
| **Anxiety Binding Shift** | Symptom moves to another person or relationship in system | FE5-28, FE9-11 |

---

## Categories of Symptom

Per FE Ch 7 and FE Ch 9, symptoms manifest in three categories but follow same underlying patterns:

| Category | Examples | Key Feature |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Physical (Medical)** | Cancer, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, asthma, heart disease | Body binds anxiety; cellular/physiological expression |
| **Emotional (Psychiatric)** | Depression, phobias, psychosis, anxiety attacks, schizophrenia | Mind binds anxiety; cognitive/feeling disturbance |
| **Social (Conduct)** | Delinquency, gambling, embezzlement, affairs, substance abuse | Behavior binds anxiety; acting out |

**NOTE**: The category that develops depends on:
1. Family patterns of focus (health-focused, character-focused, behavior-focused)
2. Individual's way of managing anxiety
3. What others in system focus on when anxious
4. Societal preoccupations and messaging

---

## What Triggers Symptom Development

| Trigger | Mechanism | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Disturbance in relationship balance | Realignment of emotional forces compromises functioning | FE9-10 |
| Addition of something new (birth, job, child) | System overloaded; new demands exceed adaptation | FE9-10, FE9-13 |
| Loss of something old (death, divorce, move) | Support system diminished; old binding mechanisms disrupted | FE9-10, FE9-15 |
| Events in extended family | Nuclear family absorbs anxiety from nodal events | FE9-18 |
| Stress exceeding adaptive capacity | Confluence of events overwhelms system | FE9-16 |
| Cutoff from extended family | Loss of emotional support and stabilizing force | FE9-19, FE9-20 |
| Chronic anxiety escalation | Chain reactions of emotional reactivity | FE9-12 |
| Symptomatic one as anxiety repository | Focus intensifies vulnerability | FE9-11 |

---

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

FE Ch 7, FE Ch 9, and FTiCP Ch 9 agree on:

1. **Systems model of symptom** - Not cause-effect; multiple factors interact (FE9-3, FE9-4)
2. **Three categories follow same patterns** - Physical, emotional, social all rooted in same process (FE7-1, FE9-7)
3. **Adapting one is most vulnerable** - Whether over or underfunctioning (FE7-9, FTiCP9-5)
4. **Symptom can stabilize system** - Chronic symptom may protect others (FE7-2)
5. **Symptom severity parallels process intensity** - Quantitative relationship (FE7-17)
6. **Cutoff increases vulnerability** - Loss of extended family support (FE9-19)
7. **Events trigger but don't cause** - Relationship reactions generate symptoms (FE9-12)

### Tensions/Nuances Between Sources

1. **FE Ch 9 emphasizes cutoff role** - More detail on extended family influence
2. **FTiCP Ch 9 emphasizes over/underfunction reciprocity** - Bowen's classic formulation
3. **FE Ch 7 emphasizes three categories** - Detailed breakdown of physical, emotional, social

---

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **Which category will develop?** - Sources say it depends on family focus patterns but don't provide operational predictors

2. **Symptom vs distress** - At what point does normal distress become "symptom"? Sources don't define threshold

3. **Symptom exchange timing** - Sources describe symptoms "shifting" but don't specify how quickly

4. **Mild vs chronic discrimination** - How to classify mild, transient symptoms vs emerging chronic patterns?

5. **Symptom in well-differentiated systems** - Can symptoms develop at high differentiation? Sources suggest yes under sufficient stress (FE7-4)

---

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Systems model (not cause-effect) | HIGH | Explicit in FE9-3 through FE9-6 |
| Three categories from same process | HIGH | Explicit in FE7-1, FE9-7 |
| Adapting one most vulnerable | HIGH | Explicit in FE7-9, FTiCP9-5 |
| Symptom can stabilize system | HIGH | Explicit in FE7-2, FE9-11 |
| Cutoff increases vulnerability | HIGH | Explicit in FE9-19, FE9-20 |
| Observable markers for categories | MEDIUM | Derived from descriptions; not explicit lists |
| When symptom vs distress | LOW | No operational threshold defined |

---

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to Symptom |
|------|------------------------|
| **Functioning (F)** | Symptom = impaired functioning; F shift DOWN may produce S |
| **Anxiety (A)** | Symptom develops when A exceeds adaptive capacity |
| **Conflict** | One mechanism for binding A; protects individuals from S |
| **Distance** | Can relieve S (insulation) or worsen S (isolation) |
| **Cutoff** | Increases S vulnerability by removing support |
| **Overfunctioning** | Overfunctioner vulnerable to S if doing too much |
| **Underfunctioning** | Underfunctioner vulnerable to S if too dependent |
| **Projection** | Child focus = child more vulnerable to S |
| **Inside/Outside** | Triangle position affects who absorbs A and develops S |
| **DefinedSelf** | Higher differentiation = lower S vulnerability |

---

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Should SARF track symptom presence vs symptom severity?
2. Should we distinguish physical/emotional/social categories or treat as unified S?
3. How do we handle symptom "exchange" - when S moves from one person to another?
4. Is symptom relief without differentiation change worth tracking?
5. What's the operational threshold for "symptom" vs "distress"?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]
