**Term:** Underfunctioning
**Extraction Date:** 2024-12-14
**Status:** Comprehensive Draft - Awaiting Calibration

## Phase 1: Source Mapping

Same sources as Overfunctioning since they are reciprocal concepts.

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 10 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 2 - The Emotional System | 5 matches | PRIMARY - detailed description |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | 3 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | 2 matches | MEDIUM - previously read |

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

Same reads as Overfunctioning - concepts developed together from same source material.

**Total lines read:** 249 lines (FE Ch 2) + 575 lines from prior reads = 824 lines

### Key Insights for Underfunctioning

1. **Not inherent incapacity**: The underfunctioner may be far more capable than the pattern allows; revealed when overfunctioner unavailable.

2. **Self-absorption is not selfishness**: Results from having given up too much self-control, not from character flaw.

3. **Symptoms from withdrawal**: Underfunctioner becomes symptomatic through withdrawal, helplessness, self-absorption.

4. **Dramatic improvement possible**: When overfunctioner becomes ill/dies, underfunctioner often improves dramatically.

5. **Extreme dependency**: At extreme, may rely on other to tell them how to think, feel, act.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Not inherent incapacity | FE2-220, FE6-55 | HIGH - explicit |
| Reciprocal pattern | FE2-216, FE7-7 | HIGH - explicit |
| Can become symptomatic | FE2-220, FE7-10 | HIGH - explicit |
| Pattern reversal possible | FE2-220, FE6-55 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from descriptions | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Emphasized hidden capacity**: Counter-intuitive but important - true capacity obscured

2. **Distinguished from inherent limitation**: Position, not personality

3. **Noted self-absorption ≠ selfishness**: Important corrective

4. **Highlighted pattern reversal**: Evidence that capacity exceeds appearance

## Phase 4: Quality Check

Same compliance as Overfunctioning - concepts developed together.

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Track together or separately?**: Since they're reciprocal, should SARF code them as a pair?

2. **Threshold**: When does appropriate dependency become underfunctioning?

3. **Distinguishing incapacity**: How distinguish inherent limitation from underfunctioning position?

4. **Recovery timeline**: How quickly can underfunctioning reverse?

5. **Hidden capacity**: Should we code hidden capacity separately?
