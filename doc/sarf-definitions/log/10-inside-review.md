## Phase 1: Source Mapping

FE Ch 6 (Triangles) is THE primary source for inside/outside positions. Already fully read.

### Search Query Results

| Source | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | PRIMARY - dedicated chapter |

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | Previously read (182 lines) | 2024-12-14 | All - triangle positions |

### Key Insights for Inside Position

1. **Two insiders, one outsider**: Basic triangle structure at any moment.

2. **Asymmetric comfort**: The two insiders are NOT equally comfortable; one often more uncomfortable.

3. **Anxiety changes experience**: At low anxiety, inside is comfortable; at high anxiety, inside becomes uncomfortable.

4. **Movement toward outside**: Uncomfortable insider tries to recruit outsider or move outside.

5. **Conflict as inside position**: Negative/conflictual relationship is still "inside" - just negative valence.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Two insiders, one outsider | FE6-13 | HIGH - explicit |
| Asymmetric comfort | FE6-15 | HIGH - explicit |
| Anxiety shifts experience | FE6-26 | HIGH - explicit |
| Triangling to recruit | FE6-17 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from examples | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Paired with Outside**: These are complementary concepts; developed together

2. **Emphasized fluidity**: Positions shift; not static

3. **Included conflict as inside**: Counter-intuitive but important - conflict is inside position

4. **Noted anxiety changes valence**: Same position feels different at different anxiety levels

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **State vs shift**: Track position or position changes?

2. **Identification**: How determine position from transcript?

3. **Multiple triangles**: Track all or primary triangle?

4. **Rapid shifts**: How handle within-session changes?

5. **Self-report**: Can people identify their own position?
