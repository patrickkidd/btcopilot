# Reasoning Log: 11-outside.md

**Term:** Outside (Triangle Position)
**Extraction Date:** 2024-12-14
**Status:** Comprehensive Draft - Awaiting Calibration

---

## Phase 1: Source Mapping

Same as Inside - FE Ch 6 (Triangles) is THE primary source.

---

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

Same reads as Inside - concepts developed together from same source material.

### Key Insights for Outside Position

1. **Outside = greater distance**: Third person at more emotional distance from intense twosome.

2. **Outside desirable at high anxiety**: At high anxiety, people fight to get outside position.

3. **Neutral outsider allows resolution**: KEY THERAPEUTIC PRINCIPLE - if outsider stays neutral, insiders can resolve.

4. **Taking sides perpetuates**: Outsider who sides with one insider intensifies the triangle.

5. **Positions shift**: Same person can be outside then inside as anxiety and reactions change.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Outside = greater distance | FE6-13 | HIGH - explicit |
| Outside desirable at high A | FE6-26 | HIGH - explicit |
| Neutral outsider therapeutic | FE6-71, FE6-85 | HIGH - explicit |
| Taking sides perpetuates | FE6-80 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from examples | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Paired with Inside**: Complementary concepts

2. **Emphasized therapeutic principle**: Neutral outside position = key therapeutic tool

3. **Distinguished from cutoff**: Outside is position within triangle; cutoff is withdrawal from system

4. **Noted dual valence**: Outside is uncomfortable at low anxiety, desirable at high anxiety

## Phase 4: Quality Check

Same compliance as Inside - concepts developed together.

---

## Open Questions for Calibration

Same questions as Inside:

1. **State vs shift**: Track position or position changes?
2. **Identification**: How determine position from transcript?
3. **Therapeutic outside**: Should we distinguish therapeutic neutrality from anxious distance?
4. **Outside vs cutoff**: Where is the boundary?
5. **Multiple triangles**: Track all or primary?
