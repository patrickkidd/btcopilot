## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 17 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality and Togetherness | 14 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 13 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | 11 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FTiCP Ch 10 - Family Therapy and Group Therapy | 12 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 16 - Theory in Practice | 10 matches | MEDIUM |
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | 7 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | 4 matches | MEDIUM |

### Source Selection Rationale

Distance is distributed across many chapters without a dedicated chapter. I've already read the highest-count chapters (FE Ch 3, 5, 6, 7, 9). Supplemented with FE Ch 4 (Differentiation) to distinguish distance from differentiation.

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | 141 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | Distance vs differentiation |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality/Togetherness | Previously read (205 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Closeness-distance continuum |
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | Previously read (141 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Distance as anxiety relief |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | Previously read (182 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Distance in triangle dynamics |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family | Previously read (305 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Distance patterns |
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | Previously read (137 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Distance → cutoff continuum |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | Previously read (129 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Distance as mechanism |

**Total new lines read:** 141 lines (FE Ch 4); plus 1,099 lines from prior reads

### Key Insights from Full Reads

1. **Distance vs differentiation is critical**: FE Ch 4 and FE Ch 9 explicitly state that "declaring independence" or "breaking away" is NOT differentiation. Distance is reactive avoidance; differentiation maintains contact with autonomy.

2. **Distance as anxiety binding**: Consistent across sources - distance is one of the three primary mechanisms (with conflict and adapting) for managing fusion anxiety.

3. **Distance shifts anxiety, doesn't resolve it**: Key insight from FE Ch 5 - distance may relieve the distancer's anxiety but can increase anxiety in the other person.

4. **Closeness-distance continuum**: FE Ch 3 describes how poorly differentiated people oscillate between addiction to closeness and urge to flee.

5. **Distance and triangles**: FE Ch 6 shows how distance in one relationship changes triangle dynamics - distancer moves toward outsider position.

6. **Distance → cutoff**: FE Ch 9 presents cutoff as extreme, chronic distance. Distance and cutoff exist on a continuum.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Distance = anxiety-binding mechanism | FE3-20, FE6-75, FTiCP9-9 | HIGH - explicit |
| Distance ≠ differentiation | FE9-22 | HIGH - explicit |
| Distance shifts (not resolves) anxiety | FE5-27 | HIGH - explicit |
| Distance follows failed closeness | FE6-77, FE6-78 | HIGH - explicit |
| Distance affects triangles | FE6-26, FE6-79 | HIGH - explicit |
| Distance → cutoff continuum | FE9-19 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from examples | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Distinguished from differentiation explicitly**: This is THE key distinction for SARF purposes; included negative definition prominently

2. **Emphasized anxiety-shifting function**: Distance relieves distancer but may increase anxiety in other - this has implications for system coding

3. **Included closeness-distance continuum**: Both extremes are problematic; equilibrium is in the middle

4. **Related to cutoff**: Distance and cutoff are on same continuum; cutoff is extreme distance

5. **Noted pursuit-distance dynamics**: When one distances, other may pursue, creating characteristic pattern

## Phase 4: Quality Check

### Methodology Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Only authorized sources | ✓ | FE (Kerr), FTiCP (Bowen) only |
| Full chapter reads (not grep snippets) | ✓ | 141 new lines + 1,099 prior |
| No AI training data | ✓ | All claims traceable |
| Passage index with search strings | ✓ | 22 indexed passages |
| Confidence ratings | ✓ | Per aspect ratings provided |
| Gaps/uncertainties documented | ✓ | 5 gaps identified |
| Cross-references to other terms | ✓ | Relationship table included |

### Internal Consistency

- All claims have supporting passages
- Distinction from differentiation is clear
- Relationship to cutoff is established

### External Consistency

- Consistent with Conflict (alternative mechanism)
- Consistent with Anxiety (distance binds A)
- Sets up Cutoff definition (extreme distance)

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Boundary with differentiation**: When is choosing to spend time alone "distance" vs healthy autonomy?

2. **Pursuit-distance coding**: When one distances and other pursues, what's the system state?

3. **Temporary vs chronic distance**: Should we distinguish?

4. **Distance as always problematic?**: Can distance ever be neutral or adaptive?

5. **Physical vs emotional distance**: Same or different for SARF purposes?
