## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 17 matches | PRIMARY - major treatment |
| FE Ch 10 - Family Evaluation | 10 matches | MEDIUM - evaluation context |
| FTiCP Ch 22 - Toward Differentiation | 7 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 16 - Theory in Practice | 6 matches | MEDIUM |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 6 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | 2 matches | HIGH - previously read |

### Source Selection Rationale

1. **FE Ch 9 (PRIMARY)**: Contains ~25% of chapter devoted to cutoff; explains cutoff as symptom vulnerability factor
2. **FTiCP Ch 9**: Already read; cutoff intensifies nuclear family process
3. **FE Ch 6**: Already read; cutoff affects triangle dynamics and bridging cutoff

FE Ch 10 had cutoff as one of 10 evaluation areas, but file too large to read fully.

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | Previously read (137 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Cutoff section |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | Previously read (129 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Cutoff and nuclear family |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | Previously read (182 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Bridging cutoff examples |

**Total lines from prior reads:** 448 lines containing cutoff material

### Key Insights from Full Reads

1. **Cutoff manages but doesn't resolve**: FE Ch 9 is explicit - "Declaring one's 'independence' from family is not differentiation of self." The attachment remains latent.

2. **Cutoff increases nuclear family intensity**: FTiCP Ch 9 explains that when spouses are cut off from extended families, they become more dependent on each other - emotional process intensifies.

3. **Cutoff exists on continuum**: FE Ch 9 states cutoff exists "in degrees" - not binary.

4. **Bridging cutoff reduces symptoms**: FE Ch 9 states symptom reduction can be "dramatic" when extended family contact is improved.

5. **Cutoff replicates across generations**: FE Ch 6 examples show how cutoff patterns are transmitted.

6. **Cutoff can be physical OR emotional**: One can be geographically distant but connected, or physically present but emotionally cut off.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Cutoff manages, doesn't resolve | FE9-21, FE9-22 | HIGH - explicit |
| Cutoff increases nuclear family intensity | FTiCP9-11, FTiCP9-12 | HIGH - explicit |
| Cutoff exists on continuum | FE9-19 | HIGH - explicit |
| Cutoff increases symptom vulnerability | FE9-19, FE9-20 | HIGH - explicit |
| Bridging cutoff reduces symptoms | FE9-24, FE9-25 | HIGH - explicit |
| Cutoff can be physical or emotional | FTiCP9-10 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from examples | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Emphasized "managing not resolving"**: This is THE key insight - cutoff looks like independence but isn't

2. **Distinguished from distance**: Cutoff is extreme, chronic, intergenerational distance

3. **Included symptom vulnerability link**: Critical for SARF purposes - cutoff predicts symptom risk

4. **Included bridging cutoff markers**: Important for tracking improvement

5. **Noted continuum**: Not binary; degrees of cutoff

## Phase 4: Quality Check

### Methodology Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Only authorized sources | ✓ | FE (Kerr), FTiCP (Bowen) only |
| Full chapter reads (not grep snippets) | ✓ | 448 lines from prior reads |
| No AI training data | ✓ | All claims traceable |
| Passage index with search strings | ✓ | 16 indexed passages |
| Confidence ratings | ✓ | Per aspect ratings provided |
| Gaps/uncertainties documented | ✓ | 5 gaps identified |
| Cross-references to other terms | ✓ | Relationship table included |

### Internal Consistency

- All claims have supporting passages
- Relationship to distance is clear (cutoff = extreme distance)
- Symptom connection is documented

### External Consistency

- Consistent with Distance definition (cutoff = extreme version)
- Consistent with Symptom definition (cutoff increases vulnerability)
- Consistent with Anxiety definition (cutoff affects chronic A)

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Scope**: Is cutoff only from family of origin, or can it apply to siblings, adult children?

2. **Threshold**: Where does "distance" become "cutoff"?

3. **Justified cutoff**: Is cutoff from abusive family different? Sources don't address.

4. **Partial cutoff**: Cut off from mother but not father - how to code?

5. **Degree tracking**: Should SARF track degree of cutoff or just presence?
