## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | 60 matches | PRIMARY - dedicated chapter |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 77 matches | HIGH - binding mechanisms |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality and Togetherness | 46 matches | HIGH - togetherness connection |
| FE Ch 8 - Multigenerational Emotional Process | 33 matches | MEDIUM - generational transmission |
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 31 matches | MEDIUM - symptom context |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | 30 matches | MEDIUM - triangle context |
| Havstad Weight Loss Article | 25 matches | HIGH - operationalized as variable |
| Gilbert (NOT AUTHORIZED) | 57 matches | EXCLUDED per methodology |

### Source Selection Rationale

1. **FE Ch 5 (PRIMARY)**: Dedicated chapter on chronic anxiety; contains core distinction between acute and chronic; defines anxiety as fundamental variable
2. **FE Ch 7**: Shows how anxiety is bound in nuclear family patterns; complements Ch 5 theory with family system application
3. **FE Ch 3**: Links anxiety to individuality-togetherness balance; explains relationship-generated anxiety
4. **Havstad**: Operationalizes anxiety as research variable; demonstrates trackability over time

Excluded FTiCP chapters (insufficient density for this term) and Gilbert (not authorized per methodology).

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | 141 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | All - dedicated to concept |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality/Togetherness | 205 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | Anxiety/togetherness connection |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family | 305 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | Anxiety binding mechanisms |
| Havstad Weight Loss Article | 127 lines (full article) | 2024-12-14 | Anxiety as research variable |

**Total lines read:** 778 lines across 4 primary sources

### Key Insights from Full Reads

1. **FE Ch 5 establishes foundational definition**: Anxiety = response to threat, real or imagined; KEY DISTINCTION is acute vs chronic; chronic is fed by imagination, not reality

2. **Relationship-generated anxiety**: The sources consistently emphasize that chronic anxiety is generated more by REACTIONS to disturbances in relationship balance than by the events themselves

3. **"Infectious" nature**: Anxiety "rubs off" on people; transmitted and absorbed without thinking; can infect entire family through chain reactions

4. **Inverse relationship to differentiation**: Lower differentiation = higher average chronic anxiety; this is stated explicitly and consistently across sources

5. **Anxiety binding mechanisms**: Distance, conflict, overfunctioning-underfunctioning, projection all bind anxiety; different families favor different patterns

6. **Havstad operationalization**: Treats anxiety as a trackable variable that shifts with family system shifts; provides temporal sequence (family shift → anxiety shift → symptom change)

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Anxiety = response to threat, real/imagined | FE5-1 | HIGH - explicit |
| Acute vs chronic distinction | FE5-3 | HIGH - explicit, foundational |
| Chronic generated by relationship reactions | FE5-4, FE5-5 | HIGH - explicit, repeated |
| "Infectious" transmission | FE5-9, FE5-23 | HIGH - explicit |
| Inversely related to differentiation | FE5-7, FE3-23 | HIGH - explicit |
| Binding mechanisms (distance, conflict, etc.) | FE5-15, FE3-20, FE7-1 | HIGH - explicit |
| Trackable variable | H-1, H-3, H-4 | HIGH - demonstrated in research |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Structured around acute/chronic distinction**: This is THE foundational distinction for understanding anxiety in Bowen Theory; organized definition around this

2. **Emphasized relationship-generated nature**: Distinguish from common understanding of anxiety as event-triggered; relationship reactions are primary generator

3. **Created separate sections for "what is" and "what is NOT"**: Per methodology; clarifies boundaries

4. **Observable markers organized by UP/DOWN shifts**: For SARF classification, direction of shift is key; organized markers accordingly

5. **Cross-reference section added**: Shows convergence across all 4 sources on core claims; notes where Havstad adds operationalization

## Phase 4: Quality Check

### Methodology Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Only authorized sources | ✓ | FE (Kerr), Havstad only |
| Full chapter reads (not grep snippets) | ✓ | 778 total lines read |
| No AI training data | ✓ | All claims traceable |
| Passage index with search strings | ✓ | 54 indexed passages |
| Confidence ratings | ✓ | Per aspect ratings provided |
| Gaps/uncertainties documented | ✓ | 4 gaps identified |
| Cross-references to other terms | ✓ | Relationship table included |

### Internal Consistency

- All claims in operational definition have supporting passages in index
- No claims made without source support
- Confidence ratings reflect source explicitness

### External Consistency

- Definition consistent with Functioning (01-functioning.md) regarding inverse relationship
- Anxiety binding mechanisms will need to align with upcoming Conflict, Distance, Overfunctioning, Underfunctioning, Projection definitions

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Acute vs chronic for SARF**: Is this distinction operationally useful for transcript classification, or should SARF focus only on chronic anxiety markers?

2. **Shift direction tracking**: Should we track A shift UP vs DOWN, or just presence of anxiety markers?

3. **Bound vs expressed anxiety**: How do we code anxiety that is "bound" (e.g., in distance or symptom) vs anxiety that is expressed verbally?

4. **Multi-person tracking**: Given anxiety's "infectious" nature, should we track multiple people's A simultaneously in family sessions?

5. **Anxiety vs functioning relationship**: Are A shift UP and F shift DOWN always coupled, or can they diverge?

6. **Observable window**: Sources describe shifts over days-months; what's minimum window for transcript classification?
