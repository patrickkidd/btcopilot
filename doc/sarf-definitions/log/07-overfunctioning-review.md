## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 10 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 2 - The Emotional System | 5 matches | PRIMARY - detailed description |
| FTiCP Ch 12 - Alcoholism and the Family | 4 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | 3 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 3 matches | MEDIUM |
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | 2 matches | MEDIUM - previously read |

### Source Selection Rationale

1. **FE Ch 2 (PRIMARY)**: Contains detailed description of overfunctioning-underfunctioning reciprocity
2. **FE Ch 7**: Already read; dominant-subordinate pattern
3. **FTiCP Ch 9**: Already read; overadequate-inadequate reciprocity
4. **FE Ch 4**: Already read; pseudo-self exchange

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 2 - The Emotional System | 249 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | Over/under reciprocity section |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family | Previously read (305 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Dysfunction patterns |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | Previously read (129 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Reciprocity |
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | Previously read (141 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Pseudo-self |

**Total new lines read:** 249 lines (FE Ch 2); plus 575 lines from prior reads

### Key Insights from Full Reads

1. **Reciprocal pattern is fundamental**: FE Ch 2 is explicit that overfunctioning and underfunctioning SHAPE each other - neither exists in isolation.

2. **Pattern reversal is dramatic**: When overfunctioner becomes ill/dies, underfunctioner often improves dramatically. This reveals true capacity.

3. **Either position can become symptomatic**: Both overfunctioner (from overload) and underfunctioner (from helplessness) are vulnerable.

4. **Borrowed pseudo-self**: FE Ch 4 explains that overfunctioner's higher functioning is partly borrowed; can be lost.

5. **Anxiety intensifies pattern**: At higher stress, both positions become more extreme.

6. **Not inherent capacity**: The pattern obscures true capacity of both parties.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Reciprocal pattern | FE2-216, FE7-7 | HIGH - explicit |
| Either can become symptomatic | FE7-9, FE7-10 | HIGH - explicit |
| Pattern reversal possible | FE2-220, FE6-55 | HIGH - explicit |
| Anxiety intensifies | FE7-8 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from descriptions | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Emphasized reciprocity**: THE key insight - these are paired concepts

2. **Created both definitions together**: Since they're reciprocal, both written simultaneously

3. **Highlighted pattern reversal**: Counter-intuitive but important - underfunctioner can improve

4. **Distinguished from differentiation**: Overfunctioning ≠ high differentiation

5. **Noted symptom vulnerability**: Both positions at risk

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Track together or separately?**: Since they're reciprocal, should SARF code them as a pair?

2. **Threshold**: When does competence become overfunctioning?

3. **Domain-specific**: Can one overfunction in one area only?

4. **Always problematic?**: Can overfunctioning ever be adaptive?

5. **Change dynamics**: Can one change without the other changing?
