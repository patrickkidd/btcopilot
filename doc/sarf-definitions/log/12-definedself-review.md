## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Key Sources

| Source | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | PRIMARY - dedicated chapter |
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | HIGH - principle-based functioning |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | HIGH - detriangling I-positions |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality/Togetherness | MEDIUM - tolerance of difference |
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | MEDIUM - differentiation vs cutoff |

All chapters previously read during prior term extractions.

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

All sources previously read; material synthesized from across chapters:

| Source | Lines Read | Date |
|--------|------------|------|
| FE Ch 4 - Differentiation of Self | 141 lines | Previously read |
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | 141 lines | Previously read |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | 182 lines | Previously read |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality/Togetherness | 205 lines | Previously read |
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 137 lines | Previously read |

**Total prior reads:** 806 lines relevant to DefinedSelf

### Key Insights

1. **Defined self vs pseudo-self distinction**: Critical. Pseudo-self can look like differentiation but collapses under pressure.

2. **Principle-based vs feeling-based**: Defined self operates on principle; requires anxiety tolerance.

3. **Maintaining contact**: KEY DISTINCTION from cutoff. "Declaring independence is not differentiation" - must stay engaged.

4. **Actions > words**: Defined self must be acted on to have impact; talk alone insufficient.

5. **Distinguishing thinking from feeling**: Core skill. Recognizing which responses are feeling-based vs thinking-based.

6. **Temporary anxiety increase**: Differentiating moves raise system anxiety initially; regression provides immediate relief but long-term cost.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| I-statements = defined self | FE6-108 | HIGH - explicit |
| Principle-based | FE5-34 | HIGH - explicit |
| Maintains contact | FE9-22 | HIGH - explicit |
| Actions over words | FE6-127 | HIGH - explicit |
| Distinguished from pseudo-self | FE4-82 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from descriptions | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Distinguished from pseudo-self**: Critical for understanding; included contrast table

2. **Emphasized contact maintenance**: Cutoff ≠ differentiation; this is counter-intuitive

3. **Included non-DefinedSelf markers**: Equally important for classification

4. **Noted temporary anxiety increase**: Important for understanding system response

5. **Connected to all other terms**: DefinedSelf is the therapeutic action that affects all other variables

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Scope**: Every I-statement or only substantive positions?

2. **Authenticity**: How distinguish real defined self from well-articulated pseudo-self?

3. **System response**: Should we track how system responds to DefinedSelf?

4. **Attribution**: Code for speaker or statement?

5. **Partial definitions**: What about good form but anxious delivery?
