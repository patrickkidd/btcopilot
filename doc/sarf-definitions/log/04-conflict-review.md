## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 25 matches | HIGH - previously read |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | 15 matches | PRIMARY - triangle context |
| FTiCP Ch 10 - Family Therapy and Group Therapy | 17 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 21 - On Differentiation of Self | 15 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 16 - Theory in Practice of Psychotherapy | 12 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | 10 matches | HIGH - three mechanisms |
| FE Ch 3 - Individuality and Togetherness | 7 matches | MEDIUM |
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | 3 matches | MEDIUM - conflict cycles |

### Source Selection Rationale

1. **FE Ch 6 (PRIMARY)**: Conflict is deeply embedded in triangle dynamics; this chapter explains how conflict is one "side" of a triangle and how it shifts
2. **FTiCP Ch 9**: Lists conflict as one of three marital mechanisms for managing fusion; key definitional text
3. **FE Ch 7**: Already read; covers conflict as dysfunction pattern
4. **FE Ch 5**: Already read; covers conflict cycles driven by anxiety

Did not re-read FE Ch 7 (already comprehensive from prior reads).

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | 182 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | All - triangle dynamics |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | Previously read (129 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Three mechanisms |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family | Previously read (305 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Dysfunction patterns |
| FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety | Previously read (141 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Conflict cycles |

**Total new lines read:** 182 lines (FE Ch 6); plus 575 lines from prior reads

### Key Insights from Full Reads

1. **Conflict as triangle side**: FE Ch 6 fundamentally reframes conflict - it's the "negative side" of a triangle, allowing other sides to remain positive. This is critical for understanding when conflict appears and disappears.

2. **Neither gives in**: The FTiCP Ch 9 definition is precise - conflict is when NEITHER party accommodates. This distinguishes it from the over/underfunctioning pattern where one adapts.

3. **Conflict shifts location**: Through triangles, conflict can move from one relationship to another (e.g., marital tension "acted out" between father and daughter). The original relationship becomes calm.

4. **Conflict can be enduring**: Conflictual marriages can last because the emotional investment (though negative) keeps partners engaged. This is counter-intuitive.

5. **Detriangling resolves conflict**: A neutral third person who stays in contact but doesn't take sides allows the conflicting pair to resolve their tension. This is the therapeutic principle.

6. **Conflict doesn't cause child symptoms**: Sources are explicit that child symptoms can develop without marital conflict, and marital conflict doesn't cause child symptoms. Important negative definition.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Conflict = anxiety-binding mechanism | FTiCP9-12, FE6-75 | HIGH - explicit |
| Neither gives in (distinguisher) | FTiCP9-12 | HIGH - explicit |
| Conflict = negative side of triangle | FE6-19, FE6-21 | HIGH - explicit |
| Conflict can shift location | FE6-24, FE6-40 | HIGH - explicit |
| Conflict doesn't cause child symptoms | FTiCP9-15 | HIGH - explicit |
| Conflict maintains engagement | FTiCP9-17, FTiCP9-18 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from examples | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Embedded in triangle framework**: Unlike other terms, conflict is best understood through triangle dynamics; organized definition accordingly

2. **Distinguished from over/underfunctioning**: Key discriminator is that NEITHER gives in; this is why conflict is separate from adaptive patterns

3. **Included conflict-shift dynamics**: Important for SARF coding - conflict can appear in one relationship while originating from another

4. **Noted detriangling principle**: Therapeutic relevance - neutral third allows resolution

5. **Emphasized NOT causation**: Conflict doesn't cause symptoms; it's a manifestation of undifferentiation and anxiety

## Phase 4: Quality Check

### Methodology Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Only authorized sources | ✓ | FE (Kerr), FTiCP (Bowen) only |
| Full chapter reads (not grep snippets) | ✓ | 182 new lines + 575 prior |
| No AI training data | ✓ | All claims traceable |
| Passage index with search strings | ✓ | 39 indexed passages |
| Confidence ratings | ✓ | Per aspect ratings provided |
| Gaps/uncertainties documented | ✓ | 5 gaps identified |
| Cross-references to other terms | ✓ | Relationship table included |

### Internal Consistency

- All claims in operational definition have supporting passages
- Triangle framework consistent throughout
- Confidence ratings reflect source explicitness

### External Consistency

- Consistent with Anxiety definition (conflict intensified by A)
- Consistent with Symptom definition (conflict as alternative to symptom)
- Will need alignment with Distance definition (alternative mechanism)

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Intensity threshold**: How much disagreement constitutes "conflict" vs normal interaction? Sources don't define threshold.

2. **Episode vs pattern**: Should SARF code single conflictual exchanges or only sustained patterns?

3. **Conflict always negative?**: In SARF terms, is conflict always problematic, or can it be neutral (just binding anxiety)?

4. **Location tracking**: Should we track WHERE conflict is (marital, parent-child, sibling)?

5. **Conflict shift coding**: When conflict moves from one relationship to another, how do we code the transition?

6. **Relationship to criticism**: Is one critical remark "conflict"? Or does it require mutual engagement?
