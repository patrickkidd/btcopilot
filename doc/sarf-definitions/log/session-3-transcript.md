## Claude's Process

### Initial Setup

First, I read:
- The plan at `~/.claude/plans/breezy-prancing-book.md`
- The methodology at `btcopilot/doc/sarf-definitions/METHODOLOGY.md`
- The progress file at `btcopilot/doc/sarf-definitions/PROGRESS.md`
- The completed Functioning definition at `01-functioning.md` as template
- The completed reasoning log at `log/01-functioning-review.md` as template

Created a todo list to track all 11 remaining terms plus the PROGRESS.md update.

### Term 2: ANXIETY

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `anxiety|anxious` across all bowentheory sources
- Found high counts in:
  - FE Ch 5 - Chronic Anxiety: 60 matches (PRIMARY - dedicated chapter)
  - FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System: 77 matches
  - FE Ch 3 - Individuality and Togetherness: 46 matches
  - FE Ch 8 - Multigenerational: 33 matches
  - FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development: 31 matches
  - Havstad: 25 matches
- Note: Gilbert was excluded per methodology (NOT an authorized source)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- Read FE Ch 5 (Chronic Anxiety): 141 lines - full chapter
- Read FE Ch 3 (Individuality/Togetherness): 205 lines - full chapter
- Read FE Ch 7 (Nuclear Family): 305 lines - full chapter
- Read Havstad article: 127 lines - full article
- **Total: 778 lines**

**Key Insights:**
1. Acute vs chronic distinction is foundational - chronic is fed by imagination, not reality
2. Chronic anxiety generated more by REACTIONS to relationship disturbance than by events
3. Anxiety is "infectious" - transmits without thinking; can infect entire family
4. Inversely related to differentiation - lower diff = higher chronic anxiety
5. Anxiety binding mechanisms: distance, conflict, over/underfunctioning, projection

**Phase 3 - Definition Synthesis:**
- Created `02-anxiety.md` with full 3-part structure
- Indexed 54 passages with search strings
- Documented 6 convergences across sources, 4 gaps

**Phase 4 - Quality Check:**
- Created `log/02-anxiety-review.md` documenting the process

---

### Term 3: SYMPTOM

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `symptom|symptoms|symptomatic|dysfunction`
- Primary sources: FE Ch 9 (38), FE Ch 7 (72), FE Ch 8 (43), FTiCP Ch 9 (20)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- Read FE Ch 9 (Symptom Development): 137 lines - full chapter (PRIMARY)
- Read FTiCP Ch 9 (Use of Family Theory): 129 lines - full chapter
- FE Ch 7 already read for Anxiety
- **Total new: 266 lines + 305 prior = 571 lines**

**Key Insights:**
1. Systems model is FOUNDATIONAL - not cause-effect
2. Three categories (physical, emotional, social) are NOT qualitatively different - same patterns
3. "Who gets symptom" is not random - determined by who makes most adjustments
4. Cutoff is major vulnerability factor (~25% of FE Ch 9)
5. Symptom can STABILIZE system - counter-intuitive but important
6. Events trigger but don't cause - relationship process generates symptoms

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `03-symptom.md` with 52 indexed passages
- Created `log/03-symptom-review.md`

---

### Term 4: CONFLICT

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `conflict|marital conflict|conflictual`
- Primary sources: FE Ch 7 (25), FE Ch 6 (15), FTiCP Ch 10 (17), FTiCP Ch 9 (10)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- Read FE Ch 6 (Triangles): 182 lines - full chapter (PRIMARY for conflict as triangle side)
- FTiCP Ch 9, FE Ch 7, FE Ch 5 already read
- **Total new: 182 lines + 575 prior = 757 lines**

**Key Insights:**
1. Conflict is anxiety-binding mechanism - one of three primary mechanisms
2. In conflict, NEITHER gives in - distinguishes from over/underfunctioning pattern
3. Conflict can be "negative side" of triangle - allows other sides to stay positive
4. Conflict can shift location via triangles - moves between relationships
5. Conflict does NOT cause child symptoms - explicit in sources
6. Conflictual marriages can be enduring - emotional investment (negative) keeps engaged

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `04-conflict.md` with 39 indexed passages
- Created `log/04-conflict-review.md`

---

### Term 5: DISTANCE

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `distance|emotional distance|distancing|distant`
- Found distributed across many chapters without dedicated chapter
- Highest counts in already-read chapters: FE Ch 7 (17), FE Ch 3 (14), FE Ch 9 (13), FE Ch 6 (11)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- Read FE Ch 4 (Differentiation of Self): 141 lines - to distinguish distance from differentiation
- All other high-count chapters already read
- **Total new: 141 lines + 1,099 prior = 1,240 lines**

**Key Insights:**
1. Distance vs differentiation is CRITICAL distinction - distance is reactive, differentiation maintains autonomy in contact
2. Distance as anxiety binding - one of three primary mechanisms
3. Distance shifts anxiety, doesn't resolve it - may relieve distancer but increase other's anxiety
4. Closeness-distance continuum - both extremes problematic
5. Distance can be physical OR emotional
6. Distance → cutoff continuum - cutoff is extreme, chronic distance

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `05-distance.md` with 22 indexed passages
- Created `log/05-distance-review.md`

---

### Term 6: CUTOFF

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `cutoff|cut off|cut-off|emotional cutoff`
- Primary sources: FE Ch 9 (17), FE Ch 10 (10), FTiCP Ch 22 (7), FTiCP Ch 16 (6)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- FE Ch 9 already read (contains major cutoff section)
- FE Ch 10 too large to read fully - used grep excerpts
- FTiCP Ch 9, FE Ch 6 already read
- **Total from prior reads: 448 lines containing cutoff material**

**Key Insights:**
1. Cutoff manages but doesn't RESOLVE fusion - "Declaring independence is not differentiation"
2. Attachment remains latent - can be revived with contact
3. Cutoff increases nuclear family intensity - spouses more dependent on each other
4. Cutoff exists on continuum - not binary
5. Bridging cutoff can dramatically reduce symptoms
6. Cutoff replicates across generations

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `06-cutoff.md` with 16 indexed passages
- Created `log/06-cutoff-review.md`

---

### Terms 7 & 8: OVERFUNCTIONING and UNDERFUNCTIONING

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `overfunctioning|underfunctioning|over-functioning|under-functioning`
- Also searched `dominant|subordinate|overadequate|inadequate`
- Primary sources: FE Ch 7 (10), FE Ch 2 (5), FTiCP Ch 9 (3)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- Read FE Ch 2 (The Emotional System): 249 lines - full chapter (contains detailed reciprocity description)
- FE Ch 7, FTiCP Ch 9, FE Ch 4 already read
- **Total new: 249 lines + 575 prior = 824 lines**

**Key Insights:**
1. RECIPROCAL pattern is fundamental - they SHAPE each other; neither exists in isolation
2. Pattern reversal is dramatic - when overfunctioner ill/dies, underfunctioner often improves
3. Either position can become symptomatic - from overload OR from helplessness
4. Borrowed pseudo-self - overfunctioner's higher functioning is partly borrowed
5. Underfunctioner's true capacity obscured by pattern
6. Self-absorption in underfunctioner is NOT selfishness - from giving up too much self-control

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `07-overfunctioning.md` with 18 indexed passages
- Created `08-underfunctioning.md` with related passages
- Created `log/07-overfunctioning-review.md`
- Created `log/08-underfunctioning-review.md`

---

### Term 9: PROJECTION

**Phase 1 - Source Mapping:**
- Ran grep for `projection|project|family projection|projected`
- Found 401 occurrences across 28 files
- Primary sources: FTiCP Ch 8 (31), FTiCP Ch 10 (17), FTiCP Ch 18 (17), FTiCP Ch 16 (15)

**Phase 2 - Full Contextual Reads:**
- FTiCP Ch 10 too large - used grep excerpts for key passages
- FTiCP Ch 9, FE Ch 6, FE Ch 7 already read
- **Grep excerpts + prior reads sufficient**

**Key Insights:**
1. Projection is UNIVERSAL - exists in ALL families; matter of degree
2. One child receives more intense projection - not evenly distributed
3. Both parents participate - father supports mother's emotional involvement
4. Doesn't require marital conflict - can occur in calm marriages (counter-intuitive)
5. Alleviates parental anxiety at child's expense
6. Projection triangle: mother-father-child configuration

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `09-projection.md` with 15 indexed passages
- Created `log/09-projection-review.md`

### Terms 10 & 11: INSIDE and OUTSIDE (Triangle Positions)

**Phase 1-2:**
- FE Ch 6 (Triangles) is THE primary source - already fully read (182 lines)

**Key Insights for INSIDE:**
1. Two insiders, one outsider - basic triangle structure
2. Asymmetric comfort - the two insiders are NOT equally comfortable
3. Anxiety changes experience - at low anxiety inside is comfortable; at high anxiety it becomes uncomfortable
4. Conflict is inside position (negative valence)
5. Uncomfortable insider tries to recruit outsider or move outside

**Key Insights for OUTSIDE:**
1. Outside = greater emotional distance from intense twosome
2. Outside desirable at HIGH anxiety - people fight to get there
3. Neutral outsider allows resolution - KEY THERAPEUTIC PRINCIPLE
4. Taking sides perpetuates triangle
5. Positions shift with anxiety

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `10-inside.md` with 10 indexed passages
- Created `11-outside.md` with 11 indexed passages
- Created `log/10-inside-review.md`
- Created `log/11-outside-review.md`

---

### Term 12: DEFINEDSELF

**Phase 1-2:**
- Material distributed across FE Ch 4, FE Ch 5, FE Ch 6, FE Ch 3, FE Ch 9
- All chapters already read - **806 lines relevant to DefinedSelf**

**Key Insights:**
1. Defined self vs pseudo-self distinction is CRITICAL - pseudo-self collapses under pressure
2. Principle-based vs feeling-based - defined self operates on principle; requires anxiety tolerance
3. Maintaining contact is KEY - "Declaring independence is not differentiation"
4. Actions > words - defined self must be acted on
5. Distinguishing thinking from feeling - core skill
6. Temporary anxiety increase - differentiating moves raise system anxiety initially

**Phase 3-4:**
- Created `12-definedself.md` with 16 indexed passages
- Created `log/12-definedself-review.md`
