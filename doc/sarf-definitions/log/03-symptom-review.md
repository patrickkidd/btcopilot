## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 38 matches | PRIMARY - dedicated chapter |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family Emotional System | 72 matches | HIGH - symptom categories |
| FE Ch 8 - Multigenerational Emotional Process | 43 matches | MEDIUM - transmission |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | 20 matches | HIGH - Bowen's clinical view |
| FTiCP Ch 10 - Family Therapy and Group Therapy | 32 matches | MEDIUM |
| Havstad Article | 24 matches | MEDIUM - research operationalization |

### Source Selection Rationale

1. **FE Ch 9 (PRIMARY)**: Dedicated chapter on symptom development; systems model of disease; cutoff role
2. **FE Ch 7**: Three categories of dysfunction; symptom location; reciprocity patterns
3. **FTiCP Ch 9**: Bowen's original formulation; over/underfunctioning reciprocity; "family dysfunction" framing

Did not re-read FE Ch 7 (already read for Anxiety) or Havstad (covered anxiety-symptom link).

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FE Ch 9 - Symptom Development | 137 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | All - dedicated to concept |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family | Previously read (305 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Symptom categories |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | 129 lines (full chapter) | 2024-12-14 | Clinical application |

**Total new lines read:** 266 lines across 2 new chapters (plus prior 305 from FE Ch 7)

### Key Insights from Full Reads

1. **Systems model is FOUNDATIONAL**: FE Ch 9 devotes extensive space to distinguishing systems model from cause-effect model; this is core to Bowen's symptom concept

2. **Three categories are NOT qualitatively different**: Physical, emotional, social symptoms follow SAME patterns; this is counter-intuitive and critically important

3. **"Who gets symptom" is not random**: Determined by patterns of emotional functioning, specifically who is making most adjustments to preserve system harmony

4. **Cutoff is major factor**: FE Ch 9 devotes ~25% of chapter to emotional cutoff as vulnerability factor; this was unexpected emphasis

5. **Symptom can STABILIZE system**: This is counter-intuitive - chronic symptom may protect others; family may resist symptom resolution

6. **Events trigger but don't cause**: The relationship process that follows an event generates symptoms, not the event itself

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Systems model (not cause-effect) | FE9-3, FE9-4, FE9-5 | HIGH - explicit |
| Three categories same patterns | FE7-1, FE9-7, FTiCP9-9 | HIGH - explicit |
| Adapting one most vulnerable | FE7-9, FE7-10, FTiCP9-5 | HIGH - explicit |
| Symptom can stabilize system | FE7-2, FE9-11 | HIGH - explicit |
| Cutoff increases vulnerability | FE9-19, FE9-20, FE9-23 | HIGH - explicit |
| Events trigger, don't cause | FE9-12 | HIGH - explicit |
| Symptom severity = quantitative | FE7-17 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from descriptions | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Led with systems model distinction**: This is THE key framing; symptom is evidence of system imbalance, not individual pathology

2. **Emphasized three categories follow same patterns**: Counter-intuitive but foundational; SARF may not need to distinguish categories

3. **Included cutoff section**: Unexpected emphasis in sources; critical for understanding vulnerability

4. **Created "triggers" table**: Events, transitions, losses that commonly precede symptoms

5. **Noted symptom-stabilizing function**: Important for understanding resistance to symptom resolution

## Phase 4: Quality Check

### Methodology Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Only authorized sources | ✓ | FE (Kerr), FTiCP (Bowen) only |
| Full chapter reads (not grep snippets) | ✓ | 266 new lines + 305 prior |
| No AI training data | ✓ | All claims traceable |
| Passage index with search strings | ✓ | 52 indexed passages |
| Confidence ratings | ✓ | Per aspect ratings provided |
| Gaps/uncertainties documented | ✓ | 5 gaps identified |
| Cross-references to other terms | ✓ | Relationship table included |

### Internal Consistency

- All claims in operational definition have supporting passages
- Systems model framing consistent throughout
- Confidence ratings reflect source explicitness

### External Consistency

- Consistent with Anxiety definition (A exceeding adaptive capacity → S)
- Consistent with Functioning (F shift DOWN → S)
- Will need alignment with Overfunctioning/Underfunctioning definitions

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Categories**: Should SARF distinguish physical/emotional/social or treat as unified S? Sources say same patterns underlie all.

2. **Severity tracking**: Track presence vs severity? Sources describe continuum from mild/transient to severe/chronic.

3. **Symptom exchange**: When S moves from one person to another, how do we code this? Both get S? Old S codes as resolved?

4. **Distress threshold**: What distinguishes normal distress from "symptom"? Sources don't provide operational threshold.

5. **Symptom relief types**: Should we distinguish relief via togetherness (support) from relief via differentiation? Sources suggest these are different.

6. **Multi-level symptoms**: When someone has physical AND emotional symptoms, code each or just overall S?
