## Phase 1: Source Mapping

### Search Query Results

| Source | Grep Count | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| FTiCP Ch 8 - Family Psychotherapy | 31 matches | HIGH |
| FTiCP Ch 10 - Family Therapy | 17 matches | PRIMARY - key definitions |
| FTiCP Ch 18 - Society Crisis | 17 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 16 - Theory in Practice | 15 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 21 - Differentiation of Self | 10 matches | MEDIUM |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | 9 matches | HIGH - previously read |

### Source Selection Rationale

1. **FTiCP Ch 10 (PRIMARY)**: Contains explicit definition of family projection process
2. **FTiCP Ch 9**: Already read; provides context on projection without conflict
3. **FE Ch 6**: Already read; triangle dynamics in projection
4. **FE Ch 7**: Already read; impairment of children as dysfunction category

## Phase 2: Full Contextual Reads

### Reading Log

| Source | Lines Read | Date | Key Sections |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| FTiCP Ch 10 - Family Therapy | Grep excerpts (17 matches) | 2024-12-14 | Family projection process section |
| FTiCP Ch 9 - Use of Family Theory | Previously read (129 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Projection context |
| FE Ch 6 - Triangles | Previously read (182 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Triangle dynamics |
| FE Ch 7 - Nuclear Family | Previously read (305 lines) | 2024-12-14 | Child impairment |

**Note**: FTiCP Ch 10 was too large to read fully; used grep excerpts for key passages on projection.

### Key Insights from Reads

1. **Projection is universal**: Exists in ALL families to some degree; intensity varies with differentiation level.

2. **One child receives more intense projection**: Not evenly distributed; one child usually more fused with mother.

3. **Both parents participate**: Father supports mother's emotional involvement with children.

4. **Doesn't require marital conflict**: Can occur in calm, harmonious marriages - this is counter-intuitive.

5. **Alleviates parental anxiety at child's expense**: Same process by which group functions better at expense of one.

6. **Full range of symptoms**: From mild to severe, including schizophrenia.

## Phase 3: Definition Synthesis

### Claims Mapping

| Claim | Supporting Passages | Confidence |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Projection is universal | FTiCP10-189 | HIGH - explicit |
| One child more intense | FTiCP10-183 | HIGH - explicit |
| Both parents participate | FTiCP10-181 | HIGH - explicit |
| Doesn't require marital conflict | FTiCP9-15 | HIGH - explicit |
| Full range of symptoms | FTiCP10-181 | HIGH - explicit |
| Observable markers | Derived from descriptions | MEDIUM |

### Synthesis Decisions

1. **Emphasized universality**: Important that projection exists in all families; matter of degree

2. **Included triangle structure**: Projection operates through specific mother-father-child triangle

3. **Connected to multigenerational transmission**: Projection is the MECHANISM for differentiation change across generations

4. **Noted lack of marital conflict requirement**: Counter-intuitive but important

5. **Distinguished from normal concern**: Anxiety-driven fusion vs reality-based concern

## Phase 4: Quality Check

### Methodology Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Only authorized sources | ✓ | FE (Kerr), FTiCP (Bowen) only |
| Full chapter reads (not grep snippets) | PARTIAL | FTiCP Ch 10 too large; used grep |
| No AI training data | ✓ | All claims traceable |
| Passage index with search strings | ✓ | 15 indexed passages |
| Confidence ratings | ✓ | Per aspect ratings provided |
| Gaps/uncertainties documented | ✓ | 5 gaps identified |
| Cross-references to other terms | ✓ | Relationship table included |

## Open Questions for Calibration

1. **Scope**: Code at family level or track individual parent-child dyads?

2. **Threshold**: What distinguishes normal concern from projection?

3. **Intensity**: Track projection intensity (mild, moderate, severe)?

4. **Identification**: How to identify projected-on child in transcripts?

5. **Direction**: Is projection only toward children, or can it target others?
