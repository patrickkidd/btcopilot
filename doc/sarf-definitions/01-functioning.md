# Functioning (F)

**SARF Variable** | **Priority: 1 - Core Variable** | **Status: COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT - Awaiting Calibration**

---

## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**Functioning (F)** refers to the *functional level of differentiation*—the degree to which a person currently operates from "solid self" (firmly held convictions that are not negotiable in relationships) versus "pseudo-self" (beliefs borrowed from others or adopted under emotional pressure). Unlike *basic differentiation* (which is relatively fixed after adolescence), functional level shifts based on relationship context, anxiety levels, and the "borrowing and trading of pseudo-self" within the emotional system.

**F shift UP** indicates movement toward operating from solid self:
- Taking "I position" stances: "These are my beliefs. This is what I am. This is what I will do or will not do."
- Acting on principle rather than "what feels right"
- Distinguishing feeling from fact in decision-making
- Tolerating anxiety without acting automatically to relieve it
- Maintaining functioning despite praise or criticism from others
- Taking responsibility for self without becoming overly responsible FOR others
- Staying in emotional contact while remaining outside the emotional field

**F shift DOWN** indicates movement toward operating from pseudo-self:
- Decisions based on "what feels right" or comfort-seeking
- Functioning impaired by praise or criticism from others
- Cannot distinguish "I feel" from "I believe"
- Adapting to others' emotional neediness at expense of own direction
- Giving up self under relationship pressure; negotiating pseudo-self
- Narcissistic I-statements: "I want," "I hurt," "I want my rights"
- Seeking togetherness/approval to stabilize self
- Use of "we" when "I" would be more accurate

## Key Discriminators

### What F IS (positive definition)

1. **F is the FUNCTIONAL (not basic) level of differentiation** - It fluctuates with relationship context; basic level is fixed (FE4-1, FE4-4, FT21-9, FT21-10)

2. **F can fluctuate 40+ points from basic level** - Example: basic 35 can function at 55 (borrowed strength) or drop to 15 (given up self) (FE4-5, FT9-19)

3. **F involves the ratio of solid self to pseudo-self in operation** - Higher F = operating more from solid self; lower F = operating more from pseudo-self (FT9-7, FT9-10, FT9-11)

4. **F is reciprocal within relationships** - When one gains functional self, another often loses it; "seesaw effect" (FE4-7, FE4-17, FT9-17, FT9-21, FE7-5)

5. **F is context-dependent** - May be higher at work than at home; shifts with which relationships are activated (FE4-14, FT21-34)

### What F is NOT (negative definition)

1. **F is NOT basic differentiation** - Basic is fixed after adolescence; only F shifts in adulthood (FE4-4, FT21-9)

2. **F is NOT intelligence or education** - "No direct correlation with intelligence or socioeconomic levels" (FT9-5)

3. **F is NOT the ability to CLAIM a self position** - "When someone angrily and dogmatically claims to be a 'self,' he is usually unsure of his position" (FE4-32)

4. **F is NOT the same as feeling good/stable** - Person can feel fine while operating on borrowed self; anxiety masked (FE4-10, FT21-12)

5. **F shifts are NOT permanent changes in basic differentiation** - Even dramatic shifts are "functional shift, not basic level" (FE4-12, FT21-11)

6. **High F is NOT emotional coldness** - High-scale people are "free to engage in goal-directed activity, or to lose 'self' in the intimacy of a close relationship" (FT21-16)

7. **Differentiation is NOT selfishness** - "capable of genuine concern for others without expecting something in return, but the togetherness forces treat differentiation as selfish and hostile" (FT21-24)

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

All five sources agree on:
1. **Basic vs. Functional distinction** - All sources distinguish stable basic level from fluctuating functional level
2. **Reciprocity** - F in one person affects F in others; "borrowing and trading" of self
3. **Feeling vs. Thinking** - Core discriminator is ability to distinguish and choose between these
4. **I-Position** - Clear marker of higher functioning; involves beliefs/convictions stated without attack
5. **Anxiety relationship** - F and anxiety are inversely related; rising anxiety typically lowers F
6. **Family system influence** - F shifts follow shifts in the family emotional system

### Tensions/Nuances Between Sources

1. **Havstad emphasizes F as trackable variable** - Other sources treat it more as descriptive concept; Havstad operationalizes it for research

2. **FTiCP Ch 21 emphasizes action/experiential aspect** - Bowen's personal account shows differentiation requires action in meaningful relationships, not just insight

3. **FE Ch 4 vs FTiCP Ch 9 on scale ranges** - Both describe 0-100 scale but with slightly different range descriptions; Kerr more detailed on 0-25, Bowen more detailed on middle ranges

---

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **How quickly can F shift be detected in speech?** - Sources describe shifts over "hours" to "months" but don't specify minimum observable window

2. **What distinguishes temporary F fluctuation from consolidated functional position?** - FT21-12 notes they "can appear much like basic levels to the inexperienced" but gives no clear discriminator

3. **Can F shift UP be self-reported accurately?** - Sources suggest low-F individuals may not have insight into their own functioning level (FT21-19)

4. **What about F in non-family contexts?** - Sources focus on family relationships; applicability to work/social contexts implied but not elaborated

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Basic vs functional distinction | HIGH | Explicit in all 5 sources |
| I-position as marker of high F | HIGH | Explicit in FT9-7, FT21-5, FT21-21 |
| Feeling vs thinking as core discriminator | HIGH | Explicit in FE4-21, FT9-13, FT21-14 |
| Reciprocity of F in relationships | HIGH | Explicit in all sources |
| F shifts follow anxiety shifts | HIGH | Explicit in FE4-8, H2, H6, H7 |
| Observable speech markers | MEDIUM | Inferred from descriptions; not explicitly listed for classification |
| Reliability of self-report | LOW | Sources suggest low-F may lack insight |

---

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to Functioning |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Anxiety** | Inversely related; rising A typically triggers F shift DOWN |
| **Symptom** | Emerges when F drops below threshold; "candidate for dysfunction" |
| **Conflict** | One of the mechanisms that can bind anxiety; affects F of both parties |
| **Distance** | Can mask F levels; "comfortable distance" may conceal fusion |
| **Cutoff** | Extreme distance; does not resolve underlying F issues—displaces them |
| **Overfunctioning** | F shift UP in one person at expense of another; appears as strength but is pseudo-self |
| **Underfunctioning** | F shift DOWN; giving up self to the relationship |
| **Projection** | Parent's F issues transmitted to child; child emerges with lower F |
| **Inside/Outside** | Triangle positions; ability to stay "outside" while in contact = higher F |
| **DefinedSelf** | Likely synonymous with F shift UP; taking I-position |

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Are the 95 passage search strings sufficient for PDF lookup?
2. Any passages I missed that should be indexed?
3. Do the observable markers align with how you'd classify F shifts in transcripts?
4. Any corrections to the operational definition?
5. Does the negative definition section help clarify boundaries?
6. Should F shift UP and F shift DOWN be separate codes, or just direction indicators on a single F code?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]

| FT21-5 | "establish what I have called an I position" | I position therapeutic: "The third function is to establish what I have called an 'I position,' which is part of the differentiation of a self" |
| FT21-6 | "scale is most important as a theoretical concept" | Scale for life evaluation: "The scale is most important as a theoretical concept for understanding the total human phenomenon and as a reliable instrument for making an overall evaluation of the course of a life" |
| FT21-7 | "wide shifts in the functional level of pseudo-self" | Day-to-day F unstable: "It is not possible to do day to day or week to week evaluations of scale levels because of the wide shifts in the functional level of pseudo-self in low-scale people" |
| FT21-8 | "compliment can raise the functioning level" | Praise/criticism shifts F: "A compliment can raise the functioning level of self and criticism can lower it" |
| FT21-9 | "many life experiences that can raise or lower" | Experiences shift F: "There are many life experiences that can raise or lower the functioning levels of self, but few that can change the basic level of differentiation" |
| FT21-10 | "basic level from their parental family is consolidated" | Basic consolidates in marriage: "the basic level from their parental family is consolidated in a marriage, following which the only shift is a functional shift" |
| FT21-11 | "functional shifts can be striking" | Striking F example: "The functional shifts can be striking. For example, a wife who had a functional level at marriage equal to her husband's may become de-selfed to the point of chronic alcoholism" |
| FT21-12 | "functional levels are sufficiently consolidated" | Consolidated F looks like basic: "Many of these functional levels are sufficiently consolidated so that they can appear much like basic levels to the inexperienced" |
| FT21-13 | "sensitive to opinions of those about them" | 50-75 still sensitive: "people in the 50 to 75 range of the scale have increasingly defined convictions and opinions on most essential issues but they are still sensitive to opinions of those about them" |
| FT21-14 | "characteristic of high-scale people convey" | High-scale characteristics: "They are operationally clear about the difference between feeling and thinking, and it is as routine for them to make decisions on the basis of thinking as it is for low-level people to operate on feelings" |
| FT21-15 | "relative separation of feelings and thinking" | F = control via thought: "The relative separation of feelings and thinking brings life much more under the control of deliberate thoughts, in contrast to low-scale people whose life is a pawn of the ebb and flow of the emotional process" |
| FT21-16 | "free to engage in goal-directed activity" | High F = free choice: "In relationships with others, high-scale people are free to engage in goal-directed activity, or to lose 'self' in the intimacy of a close relationship" |
| FT21-17 | "either have to avoid relationships lest they slip" | Low F trapped: "low-scale people who either have to avoid relationships lest they slip automatically into an uncomfortable fusion, or have no choice but continued pursuit of a close relationship for gratification of emotional 'needs'" |
| FT21-18 | "less reactive to praise or criticism" | High F = less reactive: "The high-scale person is less reactive to praise or criticism and he has a more realistic evaluation of his own self" |
| FT21-19 | "evaluation is either far above or far below reality" | Low F = distorted self-view: "the lower-level person whose evaluation is either far above or far below reality" |
| FT21-20 | "togetherness forces define the family members as alike" | Togetherness pressure: "The togetherness forces define the family members as alike in terms of important beliefs, philosophies, life principles, and feelings" |
| FT21-21 | "differentiating force places emphasis on I" | Differentiation = I emphasis: "The differentiating force places emphasis on 'I' in defining the foregoing characteristics. The 'I position' defines principle and action in terms of, 'This is what I think, or believe' and, 'This is what I will do or will not do'" |
| FT21-22 | "responsible I which assumes responsibility" | Responsible I: "It is the 'responsible I' which assumes responsibility for one's own happiness and comfort, and it avoids thinking that tends to blame and hold others responsible for one's own unhappiness or failures" |
| FT21-23 | "irresponsible I which makes demands on others" | Irresponsible I: "The 'responsible I' avoids the 'irresponsible I' which makes demands on others with, 'I want, or I deserve, or this is my right, or my privilege.'" |
| FT21-24 | "genuine concern for others without expecting" | High F = genuine concern: "A reasonably differentiated person is capable of genuine concern for others without expecting something in return, but the togetherness forces treat differentiation as selfish and hostile" |
| FT21-25 | "three predictable steps in the family reaction" | Family tests differentiation: "There are three predictable steps in the family reaction to differentiation. They are: (1) 'You are wrong,' or some version of that; (2) 'Change back,' which can be communicated in many different ways; and (3) 'If you do not, these are the consequences.'" |
| FT21-26 | "differentiating one can stay on course without defending" | Staying on course: "If the differentiating one can stay on course without defending self or counterattacking, the emotional reaction is usually brief and the other then expresses appreciation" |
| FT21-27 | "mutual exclusivity of togetherness and differentiation" | F vs togetherness: "when the husband's effort represented a small step toward a better level of differentiation. Had he yielded to her demand, or attacked, he would have slipped back to her level" |
| FT21-28 | "When he held his position, her emotional reaction" | Holding position = both rise: "When he held his position, her emotional reaction represented a pull-up to his level. This theoretical orientation considers this sequence a basic increase in bilateral differentiation which can never return to the former level" |
| FT21-29 | "much more separate but we are closer" | Paradox of differentiation: "We are much more separate but we are closer. The old love is gone. I miss it sometimes but the new love is calmer and better" |
| FT21-30 | "Differentiation cannot take place in a vacuum" | Differentiation is relational: "Differentiation cannot take place in a vacuum. It has to take place in relation to others, around issues important to both people" |
| FT21-31 | "meaningful relationship in which the other has to respect" | Meaningful context: "Differentiation also has to be in the context of a meaningful relationship in which the other has to respect the belief and the action stand that affirms it" |
| FT21-32 | "affirms a self around issues that can be ignored" | Can't differentiate on trivial: "One who affirms a 'self' around issues that can be ignored is quickly labeled a fool" |
| FT21-33 | "fusion into the emotional system" | Fusion observable: "I made increasing observations about the phenomenon but had no clues about effective action for maintaining objectivity while still in contact with the family" |
| FT21-34 | "objectivity would usually return within an hour" | Leaving restores objectivity: "Objectivity would usually return within an hour or two after the visit while en route home" |
| FT21-35 | "differentiated self is one who can maintain" | Differentiated self defined: "A 'differentiated self' is one who can maintain emotional objectivity while in the midst of an emotional system in turmoil, yet at the same time actively relate to key people in the system" |
| FT21-36 | "detriangled or emotionally outside the emotional field" | Detriangled posture: "The one basic principle in this method of psychotherapy involves the therapist keeping himself 'detriangled' or emotionally outside the emotional field that involves the marital twosome" |
| FT21-37 | "finally one who can control his emotional responsiveness" | One person changes triangle: "When there is finally one who can control his emotional responsiveness and not take sides with either of the other two, and stay constantly in contact with the other two, the emotional intensity within the twosome will decrease and both will move to a higher level of differentiation" |
| FT21-38 | "intensity that I considered it one of the most significant" | Bowen's breakthrough described: "For the first time in my life, I had been completely outside the family ego mass all week" |
| FT21-39 | "I had actively participated in the most intense family emotion" | Participated yet stayed out: "I had actively participated in the most intense family emotion possible and I had stayed completely out of the 'ego mass' of my very own family" |
