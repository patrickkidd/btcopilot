# Outside (Triangle Position)

**SARF Variable** | **Priority: 2 - Triangle Position** | **Status: COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT - Awaiting Calibration**

## Operational Definition

*Synthesized exclusively from the passages indexed below. Each claim is traceable to specific source passages. No AI training data used.*

**Outside** refers to one of two positions in a triangle - the position of being at greater emotional distance from the intense twosome at a given moment. At calm anxiety levels, the outside position is typically less comfortable. At high anxiety, the outside position becomes desirable, and people seek to move there.

A triangle consists of two "insiders" who are in closer emotional contact with each other, and one "outsider" who is at greater emotional distance. These positions are fluid and shift with anxiety.

**Key characteristics:**
- Outside = greater emotional distance from the intense twosome
- At low anxiety: outside position is less comfortable, excluded feeling
- At high anxiety: outside position becomes most desirable
- Outside person may be recruited by uncomfortable insider
- Outside person who remains neutral can allow insiders to resolve tension
- Outside person who takes sides perpetuates the triangle

**Observable markers of OUTSIDE position:**
- Being at emotional distance from an intense twosome
- Feeling excluded from a close relationship
- Being recruited by one insider to discuss the other
- Having opportunity to take sides or remain neutral
- Being in a calm relationship while two others are in conflict
- Having less emotional investment in a particular outcome

## Key Discriminators

### What OUTSIDE IS (positive definition)

1. **Outside = greater emotional distance** - Third is "a less comfortable outsider" at low anxiety (FE6-13)

2. **Outside is desirable at high anxiety** - "The outside position is the most comfortable and desired" when anxiety is high (FE6-26)

3. **Outsider can be recruited** - Uncomfortable insider pulls outsider in through complaints (FE6-17)

4. **Neutral outsider allows resolution** - If third person remains emotionally neutral, tension in twosome can resolve (FE6-71, FE6-85)

5. **Taking sides perpetuates triangle** - Outsider who sides with one intensifies process (FE6-80)

6. **Outside position shifts with anxiety** - Same person may be outside in one moment, inside in next (FE6-24)

### What OUTSIDE is NOT (negative definition)

1. **Outside is NOT static** - Positions are fluid, shift with anxiety and over time (FE6-24)

2. **Outside is NOT always undesirable** - At high anxiety, outside is preferred (FE6-26)

3. **Outside is NOT the same as cutoff** - Outside is position within active triangle; cutoff is withdrawal from triangle

4. **Outsider is NOT uninvolved** - Still part of triangle; affects and is affected by insiders

## Observable Speech/Behavior Markers for Classification

### Markers of OUTSIDE Position

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Distance from Twosome** | Not directly engaged in the intense relationship | FE6-13 |
| **Exclusion Language** | "They're so close"; "I'm left out"; feeling on periphery | FE6-15 |
| **Being Recruited** | Receiving complaints from one insider about the other | FE6-17 |
| **Calm While Others Conflict** | Remaining calm when other two are fighting | FE6-19 |
| **Ability to See Both Sides** | Can observe both insiders' perspectives | FE6-100 |
| **Lower Emotional Investment** | Less stake in the outcome of insiders' relationship | FE6-71 |

### Markers of Movement FROM Outside to Inside

| Category | Observable Indicators | Source |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Taking Sides** | Agreeing with one insider against the other | FE6-80 |
| **Getting Triangled** | Becoming emotionally invested in the conflict | FE6-17 |
| **Being Pushed Together** | Insiders pushing outsider toward one of them | FE6-108 |
| **Displacement** | Original insider moving out, outsider moving in | FE6-24 |

## The Neutral Outsider (Therapeutic Position)

A key therapeutic principle emerges from triangle theory:

| Outsider Behavior | Effect on Triangle | Source |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Takes side with A** | Intensifies conflict; B feels ganged up on | FE6-80 |
| **Takes side with B** | Intensifies conflict; A feels ganged up on | FE6-80 |
| **Remains neutral** | Tension in twosome can resolve | FE6-71 |
| **Pushes A and B together** | Helps them deal directly | FE6-108 |

**Therapeutic implication**: A therapist or helper who remains emotionally neutral (outside position) while staying in contact allows the conflicting twosome to work out their own issues. Taking sides perpetuates the problem.

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Convergence Across Sources

FE Ch 6 (Triangles) is the primary source for inside/outside positions:

1. **Two insiders, one outsider** - Basic triangle structure (FE6-13)
2. **Outside desirable at high anxiety** - People fight to get outside (FE6-26)
3. **Neutral outsider therapeutic** - Allows resolution (FE6-71, FE6-85)
4. **Taking sides perpetuates** - Outsider who sides intensifies (FE6-80)
5. **Position shifts** - Same person moves in and out (FE6-24)

---

## Gaps and Uncertainties

1. **Position identification in transcripts** - How to determine who is outside from speech alone?

2. **Multiple triangles** - Person can be outside in one triangle, inside in another simultaneously

3. **Position stability** - How long must someone be "out" to code as outside? Positions shift rapidly.

4. **Outside vs cutoff** - Where is the boundary between "outside triangle position" and "cut off from system"?

5. **Intentional vs reactive** - Can we distinguish therapeutic neutrality from anxious withdrawal?

## Confidence Ratings

| Aspect | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Two insiders, one outsider | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-13 |
| Outside desirable at high anxiety | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-26 |
| Neutral outsider allows resolution | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-71 |
| Taking sides perpetuates | HIGH | Explicit in FE6-80 |
| Observable markers | MEDIUM | Derived from examples |
| Position identification method | LOW | Not operationally defined |

## Relationship to Other SARF Terms

| Term | Relationship to Outside |
|------|------------------------|
| **Functioning (F)** | Outside position may protect F at high anxiety |
| **Anxiety (A)** | Higher A → outside becomes desirable |
| **Symptom (S)** | Chronic exclusion (outside at low A) → S vulnerability |
| **Conflict** | Outsider can intensify or allow resolution of conflict |
| **Distance** | Outside position involves more distance |
| **Cutoff** | Extreme/permanent outside = cutoff |
| **Overfunctioning** | May seek outside when exhausted |
| **Underfunctioning** | May be pushed outside |
| **Projection** | Child may be outside parent-parent relationship |
| **Inside** | COMPLEMENTARY - cannot exist without each other |
| **DefinedSelf** | Higher differentiation → comfortable in any position |

## Domain Expert Review

**Patrick's Feedback:** [Awaiting calibration review]

**Calibration Questions:**
1. Should we track inside/outside as states or as shifts?
2. How do we identify position from transcript alone?
3. Should we distinguish "therapeutic outside" from "excluded outside"?
4. Where is the boundary between outside and cutoff?
5. How do we handle multiple simultaneous triangles?

**Methodology Calibration Notes:** [To be added after Patrick's review]

**Final Validated Definition:** [After iteration]
