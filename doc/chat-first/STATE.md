# Chat-first rebuild — STATE (the system of record)

Read this first, every session. This is the current truth; the derivation lives in
[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md). Both are living documents under the two-clocks regime:
**append to HISTORY, revise STATE** as part of any work that changes either.
Ten-minute read by design.

## The product (ruled)

**"A coach who never forgets your family."** You talk to it (voice or text) the way
you'd talk to someone trained in Bowen theory; it asks what a trained coach asks; the
family record — structure + timeline — is its visible, touchable memory, growing for
years. Conversation drives everything, AND manual tweaking stays: chat tool calls
control everything in the app with full bidirectional reactivity (oracle R-0055).
One picture rides pinned above the chat:
strip-small at rest, cartoon-level detail, always current. Chat is the event clock
(never rewritten); the record is the state clock (corrections change it). Proactive
messages exist and default to near zero. The product's acceptance test is the felt
shift — one or two brain-rearranging correlations per user, not a dataset. Coverage
serves exactly two things: better coach questions, and the timeline's own
correlations.

No modes: one agent; coaching, app-help (manual tool), corrections, and journaling
are registers routed from context, never user-visible switches. Lanes are queries
over the existing schema, not entities (a person-variable lane; a household lane =
pair-bond + members' events; "sleep" is a label from descriptions — symptom lanes are
untyped, a known limit). Lane choice: the coach aims lanes as part of its reply;
the strip resumes where it left off; proactive messages carry their lanes; user pins
outrank everything. Within-lane density merges to worded count chips at scale.

All drawing/asking rules are canonical in [../DRAWABILITY.md](../DRAWABILITY.md)
(five drawability rules; one amber question treatment in three places; cartoon rule;
at-rest vocabulary = line, dots, question mark; words-on-tap; no legends; no
lane-filter UI; expanded view must be designed for sparse data; tokens-only styling
so themes are A/B-testable with stable semantics: teal=data, amber=asking).

**The human oracle binds all agentic development** (his ruling: among the most
valuable inputs to the entire process — canonicalized and continually maintained).
The ENTIRE store (his BKM SPEC + rulings index + evidence) is IP and lives in the
PRIVATE fdserver repo at doc/oracle/; public docs cite ruling ids ([Oracle: R-NNNN])
and never restate quotes. Ops: append/merge/split/reword; SUPERSEDED chains (newest
wins); the initial mined set (R-0001..R-0064) awaits his feature-grouped
ratification pass (SPEC §10); no raw transcripts anywhere (R-0064). Core of it: this data is far more nuanced than it looks; no rubric
or quality judgment is inferred without Patrick — he rules by example and by
correcting proposed values; scaffold vs active events (early births are age
scaffolding, not SARF material; the diagnostic period starts at the first event with
a nodal flag or variable value); max-effort model spend only on the filtered corpus.

## Architecture and stack (ruled, unbuilt except FD-360)

Keep the Flask/Celery/Postgres/Redis backend. Target shape: diagram = JSON document +
append-only command log; one Python module mutates; browser and agent are clients of
the same endpoint; agent loop in a worker streaming via Redis→SSE (async worker;
agent queue separate from long extractions); server sends patches, client has a small
reducer for optimistic drags; per-turn undo with compare-and-set inverses. Front end:
one Vite/TypeScript SVG page, phone+desktop, installed as a PWA (no Xcode, no store;
Capacitor only if store presence / locked-screen recording / hostile-Apple forces it —
a packaging step, not a rewrite). Release: PR checks → tag → one Docker image (web
bundle inside) → GHCR → one SSH compose pull. Login: passwordless (pre-authed QR/link
onboarding, months-long sessions, passkeys/Face ID, 6-digit emailed code recovery;
login IS signup for later self-serve). Migration from Pro pickles: one-shot converter,
gate = positions exact + count differences explained; hard cutover (old Pro becomes
export-only). Known debt to schedule: secrets committed in compose need rotation.

## Prototyping status (honest)

- **FD-360 page** (PR #133, draft, worktree ~/theapp/btcopilot/.claude/worktrees/FD-360):
  works and independently verified — chat through the real coach pipeline;
  session-cookie auth bridged WITHOUT touching the HMAC path (tested); CSRF added;
  per-person timeline math with a regression test against the Qt app's
  mixed-people-sum bug; resting strip obeys the three-mark rule; tap-a-mark speaks a
  plain sentence; seeded or real-record sandbox on 8889 (relaunch command in the PR /
  worker report; real-record DB at /tmp/fd360-sandbox.db). **Ruled good**: the
  narrow-lane always-on resting strip; inline chips in coach text aiming the picture.
  **Ruled not understood**: the expanded/detail view — Patrick's walk found it
  illegible on real sparse data; it is a placeholder pending ground-up design FROM
  the corpus analysis. Era-compression work exists reverted-but-recoverable at commit
  35dd13b — NOTE: that is one of the two contaminated commits, so a history purge
  deletes it (re-implement from HISTORY's description if purged).
  Rebuild/reseed: `python -m btcopilot.companion.seed <username> --from-lanes
  <chat.json> <journal.json> --alias "WRITTEN=CANONICAL"...` (identities only ever in
  the ephemeral command); sandbox: from ~/theapp, `PYTHONPATH=<FD-360 worktree>
  FLASK_APP=btcopilot.app:create_app FLASK_CONFIG=development
  FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:////tmp/fd360-sandbox.db
  FLASK_AUTO_AUTH_USER=patrickkidd+unittest@gmail.com FDSERVER_PROMPTS_PATH=<fdserver
  private_prompts.py> uv run python -m flask run -p 8889 --no-reload`.
  Open judgment calls recorded on the ticket (deferred_risk): default second lane
  needs the coach-default/pin mechanism; ask-the-coach server queue unbuilt (chips
  prefill the chat input instead); relationship keyword→kind mapping; the chat
  "Assistant" person appears in lane data; unknown-certainty dated events route to
  the shelf; rule-5 fades/death hard-stops unimplemented. One Jira closing comment on
  FD-360 is pre-authorized but HELD until Patrick reviews the PR.
- **proto.html** (durable copy: ~/fd-corpus/design/proto.html; jobs-tmp original is ephemeral): interactive two-concept prototype — REJECTED by Patrick,
  shelved. It embeds real names inside prod-derived event descriptions: NEVER publish
  or commit it; local file only. Its creative-round survivors (Chapter Shelf, Quiet Threads) and
  cross-cutting findings remain hypotheses only.
- Three artifacts stand as reference: Drawability, "Three Ways to Ask", "Flowing
  Through It" (URLs in HISTORY.md; readable any session via the Artifact tool's read action).

## The corpus (system of record for phases A and B)

Location **~/fd-corpus/** — NEVER in any repo; rebuild everything with
`rebuild.py <diagrams-dir> <out-dir>` (self-verifying allowlist, no data inside it).
- `clinic/case_01..61.json` + `index.json`: his 61 real clinical cases, one-way
  anonymized (P-ids, gender, decimal years, unsure flags, kind enums, per-variable
  direction enums incl. differentiation, nodal flag, text byte-lengths; free text
  never extracted). Content-blind protocol holds until the Anthropic BAA exists.
- `design/`: his own record (corpus_patrick_chat/journal.json), prod-derived
  comparisons (corpus_304/9/1341/757.json), and `prod_candidates.csv` — 104 prod
  diagrams (email + id; floor = ≥40 dated events AND ≥20y span AND ≥5 people; his own
  excluded; UNRANKED; volume column explicitly "not quality"; caveat: nothing in prod
  marks clinic-derived diagrams, owner-exclusion was the only cross-contamination
  filter).
- `PRIVATE_case_mapping.md`: case_NN → his actual diagram file, HIS EYES ONLY,
  regenerated on the active basis.
- `QUALITY_NOTES.md`: volume ≠ quality, in writing. `OWNER_RULINGS.md`: his teachings.

Corpus facts (details in HISTORY). **Numbers rule: never trust counts written in
docs — ~/fd-corpus/clinic/index.json is always authoritative; recompute before use.**
Computed from index.json 2026-09-01 10:44: events live in five homes; median dated-bearing case
28 dated events over ~85 years; direction tagging in 21% of his cases;
uncertainty right-skewed (median ~96% guessed); he dates marriages 2–3x more than the
prod population. Active-basis tiers: **11 cases ≥30 active, 13 at 10–29, 4 at 1–9
active (case_01/10/28/42 — NO in/out ruling yet, do not infer), 28 zero-active with
people (pure scaffold by the marker — possibly coding style; his eyeball decides),
5 blank.** Worst volume illusion currently case_13 (52 dated / 0 active).

**The active basis is itself a period measure, not a signal measure (computed
2026-09-01):** rebuild.py marks everything dated at or after the first marker-bearing
point as active, so the tiers rank the LENGTH of the diagnostic period, not how much
function he marked. Counting points that actually carry a nodal flag or a non-"none"
variable: only 6 cases have >=10, 15 have >=5, and 33 files have zero. The ranking
reorders against the active tiers (the #2 case by period has 13 marks, all bare nodal
flags with no variable value; two top-tier-by-period cases carry 3 marks each). Also:
**61 files are not 61 families** - two pairs are identical across every extracted
field (one pair inside each of the top two tiers, inflating both by one) and a third
pair shares people and nearly all events; **differentiation is never used anywhere**
(symptom most, then anxiety, then functioning, relationship rare); **every marked
point is dated** (no undated-shelf problem on the function side); marks are sparse
per person and clustered in time (densest case = 33 marks over 9 people / 30 years).

The corpus self-sorted into the two planned subsets: active-bearing → FUNCTION candidates;
zero-active-but-structure-rich → STRUCTURE candidates. **Waiting on Patrick: eyeball
via PRIVATE_case_mapping.md, rule the in-lists, and rule the four 1–9-active cases.**

**PII rule (binding, FD-360 incident is the precedent-as-rule):** real user emails
(prod_candidates.csv), case filenames, prod identifiers, and any corpus values NEVER
appear in repo docs or commits; sessions reference cases as case_NN only.

A disposable Postgres container `fd-scratch-pg` (port 55432) holds the restored July
prod dump for any further prod queries; `docker rm -f fd-scratch-pg` when done.

## The ruled working order (violations get killed)

**Filter (Patrick rules by example/correction) → A: max-effort document on the nature
of this data → B: max-effort, model-optimized generation of visual-representation
choices → build.** Nothing visual is derived before A is ratified. Model policy:
judgment on the big model; max effort ONLY on the filtered corpus; implementation to
precise spec on cheaper models; mechanics on the cheapest.

## Pending threads (designed, not landed)

- Coach elicitation upgrade: additive prompt edits (triangle/who-else questions,
  year-before probe, SARF-dimension rotation, done-rule criteria) await Patrick's
  clinical sign-off on the phrasings; the measurement instrument scores planted facts
  by transcript scan (never through extraction); the synthetic client must be fixed
  first (canned evasions ~50–60% of turns); the baseline run doubles as the tabled
  Sonnet-vs-Opus coaching test. Ruled: in-story follow-ups are exempt from the
  ~1-question/session budget (it caps only out-of-flow clarifications).

- **Notability handwritten cases (ruled 2026-09-01, corrected same day)**: NO
  anonymization machinery — no translator, no scrub guard; inference on this data is
  rare and goes straight to a BAA provider (OpenAI/Gemini) with raw content. Scope:
  PDFs (auto-backup ON, landing in Google Drive) → three-armed interpretation
  bake-off (GPT / Gemini / local Qwen-VL; keys in theapp/.env) → import script
  writes NEW .fd diagram files (originals preserved untouched) → profile the new
  diagrams exactly like the app cases (marker density, span, people) → Patrick
  eyeballs which are viable for functioning-timeline inference. Work home: PRIVATE
  btcopilot-sources. Does NOT gate the visualization prototype — only the
  FUNCTION-subset ruling does.

## Jira / branches

- FD-359 epic (chat-first web app) with FD-360 (built, draft PR #133) and FD-361
  (corrections through chat — not started). FD-341 untouched as the June plan of
  record; FD-336 superseded as the first chat surface (in docs, not yet in Jira).
- This branch (`fall-2026-direction`) carries: decision log entries, the two
  brainstorm docs, DRAWABILITY.md, and this package — draft PR #134.

## Open security items (Patrick's calls, untouched)

1. FD-360 branch git history: two commits with real personal data (f55c5b0,
   35dd13b). Recommended: delete remote branch + PR, re-push clean, reopen.
2. Public master, pre-existing: a test-fixture name, names in decisions/log.md, and
   IRR meeting transcripts under doc/irr/meetings quoting Patrick on family matters.
   Recommended: PR moving transcripts to fdserver + neutralizing names; his risk call.
3. Business model TABLED (numbers in HISTORY); LLM-provider BAAs EXIST, the ANTHROPIC
   BAA is the pending one — until it lands, clinical content never enters model
   context (structure-only corpus).
4. Oracle-store items: (a) guards are code (SPEC §7: store-integrity, oracle-outside-
   store, trace, coverage, id-stability) — follow-on ticket to implement in CI;
   (b) the workstream skill's per-ticket oracle files are a second corpus (SPEC §11)
   — unification or a bounded carve-out is his ruling; (c) the proposed tag
   vocabulary needs his ratification; (d) the store awaits parent placement into an fdserver worktree from the staged
   files (see session report); (e) his feature-grouped ratification pass over the
   initial 64-ruling set.

## What's next

The two sessions in [NEXT_SESSIONS.md](NEXT_SESSIONS.md): FUNCTION-subset and
STRUCTURE-subset needling, both gated on Patrick's tier rulings, both feeding phase A.
