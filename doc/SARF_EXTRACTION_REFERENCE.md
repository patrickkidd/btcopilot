## FUNCTIONING (F) - Core Variable

**Definition**: Functioning (F) refers to the *functional level of differentiation*
—the degree to which a person currently operates from "solid self" (firmly held
convictions not negotiable in relationships) versus "pseudo-self" (beliefs borrowed
from others or adopted under emotional pressure). Unlike basic differentiation
(fixed after adolescence), functional level shifts based on context.

**F shift UP** (toward solid self):
- Taking "I position" stances: "These are my beliefs. This is what I am. This is
  what I will do or will not do."
- Acting on principle rather than "what feels right"
- Distinguishing feeling from fact in decision-making
- Tolerating discomfort without acting automatically to relieve it
- Maintaining course despite praise or criticism from others
- Taking responsibility for self without becoming overly responsible FOR others
- Staying in emotional contact while remaining outside the emotional field

**F shift DOWN** (toward pseudo-self):
- Decisions based on "what feels right" or comfort-seeking
- Course impaired by praise or criticism from others
- Cannot distinguish "I feel" from "I believe"
- Adapting to others' emotional neediness at expense of own direction
- Giving up self under pressure; negotiating pseudo-self
- Narcissistic I-statements: "I want," "I hurt," "I want my rights"
- Seeking togetherness/approval to stabilize self
- Use of "we" when "I" would be more accurate

**What F IS**:
- The FUNCTIONAL (not basic) level of differentiation - it fluctuates with context
- Can fluctuate 40+ points from basic level (e.g., basic 35 can function at 55 or 15)
- The ratio of solid self to pseudo-self currently in operation
- Context-dependent - may be higher at work than at home

**What F is NOT**:
- NOT basic differentiation - basic is fixed; only functional shifts in adulthood
- NOT intelligence or education - "No direct correlation with intelligence"
- NOT the ability to CLAIM a self position - angry, dogmatic claims = unsure of position
- NOT the same as feeling good/stable - can feel fine while operating on borrowed self
- NOT emotional coldness - high-F people can engage intimately or in goal-directed activity
- NOT selfishness - togetherness forces treat differentiation as selfish, but it isn't

**Observable Markers - F Shift UP**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| I-Position Statements | "These are my beliefs," "This is what I will do or will not do" |
| Responsible I | "This is what I think," "I will," "I will not" |
| Principle Language | Decisions framed around principles rather than comfort |
| Staying on Course | Maintaining position despite "You are wrong," "Change back" pressure |
| No Counterattack | Staying calm, not defending/attacking when challenged |
| Self-Responsibility | Taking responsibility for outcomes without blaming others |
| Staying in Contact | Maintaining relationship despite disagreement |
| Calm Under Intensity | Participating in family emotion while staying outside "ego mass" |

**Observable Markers - F Shift DOWN**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Feeling-Based Decisions | "It feels right," "I just know," comfort-based choices |
| Irresponsible I | "I want," "I deserve," "This is my right," "I hurt" |
| Fusion Language | Use of "we" when "I" would be more accurate; speaking for others |
| Blame Language | Holding others responsible for own unhappiness or failures |
| Togetherness-Seeking | Seeking approval, validation, agreement to stabilize self |
| Reactivity to Praise/Criticism | Course shifts based on others' approval |
| Excessive Accommodation | Making adjustments to preserve harmony |

## ANXIETY (A) - Core Variable

**Definition**: Anxiety (A) refers to the response of an organism to a threat,
real or imagined. The key distinction is between **acute anxiety** (response to
real threats, time-limited) and **chronic anxiety** (response to imagined threats,
not time-limited). Anxiety is "infectious" - transmitted between people without
thinking.

**A shift UP** (anxiety increasing):
- Movement toward greater emotional reactivity
- Greater need for emotional contact/closeness OR greater need for insulation
- Less tolerance of differences in others
- More feeling of being overloaded, overwhelmed, isolated
- More pressure to adapt/accommodate
- More focus on what others think, feel, say, do
- More preoccupation with whether one is approved, accepted, rejected
- Feelings of not getting enough or giving enough

**A shift DOWN** (anxiety decreasing):
- Movement toward greater emotional autonomy
- Ability to maintain comfortable contact with emotionally significant others despite stress
- Greater tolerance for differences
- Less reactivity to praise, criticism, or perceived slights
- More ability to focus on self rather than on changing others
- Less need for emotional reinforcement

**What A IS**:
- The organism's response to threat, real or imagined
- Chronic A is fed by fear of what MIGHT be; acute A by fear of what IS
- Generated more by REACTIONS to disturbance than by the event itself
- "Infectious" - transmitted and absorbed without thinking
- Varies in the same person over time
- Escalates through chain reactions

**What A is NOT**:
- NOT always conscious - most anxiety is not conscious
- NOT solely caused by external events
- Acute anxiety is NOT chronic anxiety - different causes and time courses
- High activity is NOT the same as high anxiety - inactivity can mask high reactivity

**Observable Markers - A Shift UP**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Reactivity Increase | More intense emotional responses; less ability to think objectively |
| Focus on Others | Preoccupation with what others think, say, do; monitoring for approval |
| Togetherness Push | Striving for oneness, thinking/acting alike; pressure to conform |
| Overload Language | Feeling overwhelmed, isolated, overloaded; wishing for someone to lean on |
| Bossy/Helpless Extremes | Becoming more bossy/controlling OR more helpless/dependent |
| Blame/Criticism Cycles | Feeling criticized, getting defensive, counterattacking |
| Pursuit Cycles | Neediness triggering withdrawal, withdrawal triggering more neediness |
| Preoccupation | Ruminations; mulling over adequacy, approval, "should"/"ought" |
| Escalation Language | "I can't survive unless you..." "I can't survive if I..." |

**Observable Markers - A Shift DOWN**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Maintained Contact | Comfortable emotional contact with significant others despite stress |
| Self-Focus | Focus on being responsible for self rather than changing others |
| Tolerance of Difference | Permitting others to be what they are; less irritation |
| Calm Under Pressure | Not acting to relieve discomfort of the moment; tolerating it |
| Long-Term Thinking | Actions based on long-term view rather than immediate relief |
| Process Awareness | Recognition of own part in process; not blaming |
| Principle-Based Action | Based on principle rather than feelings |

## SYMPTOM (S) - Core Variable

**Definition**: Symptom (S) refers to evidence of dysfunction - any impairment in
physical, emotional, or social functioning. Three categories exist: physical
illness (medical disorders), emotional illness (psychiatric disorders), and
social dysfunction (conduct/criminal disorders).

**S shift UP** (symptomatic/worsening):
- Development or worsening of physical illness
- Development or worsening of emotional illness
- Development or worsening of social dysfunction
- Increased functional impairment

**S shift DOWN** (improving):
- Remission or improvement of physical illness
- Remission or improvement of emotional illness
- Remission or improvement of social dysfunction
- Improved functional capacity

**What S IS**:
- Evidence of dysfunction in the person
- Exists on a continuum of severity - from mild/transient to severe/chronic
- Three categories (physical, emotional, social) - track what is observable
- Can be chronic and stable, or acute and fluctuating

**What S is NOT**:
- NOT necessarily caused by one factor
- NOT the same as distress - symptoms involve observable impairment
- Categories (physical, emotional, social) are NOT mutually exclusive

**Observable Markers - S Development/Worsening (S UP)**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Physical Symptoms | Illness flare-up, medical diagnosis, hospitalization, new complaints |
| Emotional Symptoms | Depression, panic attacks, phobias, psychotic episodes |
| Social Symptoms | Acting out, irresponsible behavior, substance abuse, affairs |
| Functional Impairment | Cannot work, cannot perform daily tasks |
| Help-Seeking | Entering therapy, hospitalization, diagnosis sought |
| Chronicity Markers | Long-term dependence on treatment, medication, institutions |

**Observable Markers - S Relief/Improvement (S DOWN)**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Functional Improvement | Return to work, improved performance, daily function restored |
| Reduced Focus | Less preoccupation with symptoms |
| Treatment Success | Responding to treatment, reduced medication needs |

## CONFLICT - Relationship Mechanism

**Definition**: Conflict refers to a relationship pattern characterized by overt
tension, disagreement, criticism, and blame between two people. In conflict,
each person "fights for an equal share" and neither gives in.

**Key characteristics**:
- Conflict maintains emotional ENGAGEMENT
- In conflict, NEITHER person "gives in" - both maintain fighting positions
- Conflict can be chronic and cyclical, with repetitive escalation patterns
- Cycles are predictable - criticized → defensive → counterattack → repeat
- Mutually reinforcing - each person's reactivity triggers more reactivity

**What Conflict IS**:
- Overt tension, disagreement, criticism, blame between two people
- Neither gives in - each fights for position
- Can preserve marriages - conflictual marriages endure due to energy investment
- Can be the "negative side" of a triangle - allows other sides to remain calm
- NOT caused by one person - both contribute; neither is "victimizer"

**What Conflict is NOT**:
- NOT absence of emotional investment - conflictual couples may have MORE investment
- Absence of conflict is NOT evidence of healthy relationship

**Observable Markers - Conflict Present/Increasing**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Criticism-Defense Cycles | Criticize → defend → counterattack → escalation |
| Blame Language | "You always...", "You never...", "If you would just..." |
| Neither Accommodating | Both maintain position; neither "gives in" |
| Preoccupation with Other | Extensive thinking about other's faults, deficits |
| Diagnosing/Labeling | Calling other "cold," "unfeeling," "selfish," "needy" |
| Recruiting Allies | Telling others about partner's faults; seeking sympathy |
| Defending Position | "If you are not with me, you are against me" |
| Accusing/Indicting | Emotional investment shifted to negative accusations |

**Observable Markers - Conflict Decreasing/Shifting**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| One Person Adapting | "Giving in" to reduce tension; avoiding issues |
| Withdrawal | Avoiding bringing up issues; emotional insulation |
| Third Person Involvement | Talking to friend/parent about spouse instead of to spouse |
| Shifting to Child | Parents focus on child's problems; marital tension obscured |
| Detriangling Comments | Neutral remarks that don't take sides |

**CRITICAL: If conflict is ABOUT a third party, use "inside" instead of "conflict".**

---

## DISTANCE - Relationship Mechanism

**Definition**: Distance refers to a relationship pattern characterized by emotional
insulation or withdrawal from another person. Can be achieved through physical
separation, emotional withdrawal, or preoccupation.

**Key characteristics**:
- Distance provides emotional insulation from closeness
- Distance and closeness exist on a continuum
- Can be physical or emotional - same room but emotionally distant is still distance
- Can be chronic and stable - some relationships maintain fixed distance level
- Can follow failed conflict - when attempts to discuss problems fail

**What Distance IS**:
- Emotional insulation or withdrawal from another person
- Provides emotional "breathing room"
- Can be physical or emotional
- Distancer is NOT always aware of distancing - can be subtle and automatic
- NOT caused by one person - part of reciprocal pattern

**What Distance is NOT**:
- Physical distance is NOT always emotional distance - can maintain intensity across miles
- NOT the same as differentiation - distance is reactive withdrawal
- Does NOT resolve underlying fusion - attachment remains "latent" and can be revived

**Observable Markers - Distance Increasing**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Topic Avoidance | "Let's not talk about that"; avoiding "unpleasant subjects" |
| Withdrawal Behavior | Spending more time at work; preoccupation with activities |
| Third Person Involvement | Talking to others about spouse instead of to spouse |
| Reduced Responsiveness | Not reacting to partner's bids; emotional flatness |
| Physical Separation | Finding reasons to be away; scheduling conflicts |
| Substance Use | Drinking or drugs to create emotional insulation |
| Overinvestment in Others | Focus on children, extended family, work |
| Chronic Urge to Flee | Recurring feeling of wanting to escape |

**Observable Markers - Distance Decreasing/Challenged**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Connection Attempts | Renewed effort to discuss issues; reaching out |
| Neediness/Demand | Coming across as "needy and demanding" for involvement |
| Partner Reacts | Partner reacts to "excessive" distance |
| Life Events Forcing Contact | Crisis, illness, or milestone requiring interaction |

## CUTOFF - Relationship Mechanism

**Definition**: Cutoff (Emotional Cutoff) refers to the way people manage unresolved
emotional attachment to their parents and families of origin by reducing or totally
cutting off emotional contact. Distinguished from distance by intensity, chronicity,
and intergenerational focus.

**Key characteristics**:
- The emotional attachment remains beneath the cutoff; intensity suppressed, not eliminated
- Can be physical (no contact) or emotional (superficial, ritualized contact)
- Cutoff is replicated - child who cuts off tends to have children who cut off
- Exists on a continuum - degrees of cutoff, not binary

**HIGH cutoff indicated by**:
- Little or no contact with extended family members
- Highly charged, negative descriptions of family members
- Inability to discuss family without intense emotional reaction
- Denial of importance of family
- "Declaration of independence" that is really flight, not growth
- Patterns of running away from family at times of stress

**LOW cutoff indicated by**:
- Maintained contact with extended family across generations
- Ability to discuss family members with emotional neutrality
- Comfort with visiting family without being destabilized
- Realistic assessment of family strengths and weaknesses
- Contact that is genuine, not just ritualized obligation

**What Cutoff IS**:
- Extreme, chronic emotional distance across generations
- Does NOT resolve the emotional attachment - "broken away but not grown away"
- The old attachment remains latent - can be revived with emotional contact
- Can be physical OR emotional - present but emotionally distant counts
- Is replicated across generations

**What Cutoff is NOT**:
- NOT healthy independence - it's emotionally reactive avoidance
- Does NOT eliminate the emotional connection - connection persists beneath surface
- Physical distance is NOT automatically cutoff - can be distant but emotionally connected

**Observable Markers - HIGH Cutoff**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| No Contact | Hasn't spoken to parent/sibling for years; refuses invitations |
| Negative Intensity | "I can't stand her"; "He's dead to me"; extreme descriptions |
| Topic Avoidance | Won't discuss family; "I don't want to talk about them" |
| Physical Flight | Moved far away; arranged life to avoid family events |
| Declaration Language | "I'm done with them"; "I've moved on"; "They're toxic" |
| Denial of Importance | "Family doesn't matter to me"; "I've made my own family" |
| Ritualized Contact Only | Christmas card only; obligatory brief visits; no real connection |
| Intense Reactivity | Family mentioned → immediate strong emotional response |

**Observable Markers - LOW Cutoff/Bridging Cutoff**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Maintained Contact | Regular communication; attends family events |
| Emotional Neutrality | Can discuss family without intense reaction |
| Realistic Assessment | Sees family as individuals with strengths and weaknesses |
| Comfort with Visits | Can visit family without being destabilized |
| Renewed Connection | Making effort to reconnect with cut-off relatives |
| Objectivity about Past | "I understand why they did what they did" |

---

## OVERFUNCTIONING - Relationship Mechanism

**Definition**: Overfunctioning refers to a reciprocal relationship position in
which a person feels responsible for the well-being of others, works to compensate
for perceived deficits in others, and does more than their share.

**Key characteristics**:
- Overfunctioning exists ONLY in relationship to underfunctioning - reciprocal positions
- The overfunctioner feels responsible for others' well-being
- Works to compensate for perceived deficits in others
- Derives sense of well-being from doing for others - worth tied to being needed
- NOT caused by the overfunctioner alone - underfunctioner participates by allowing it

**What Overfunctioning IS**:
- A reciprocal position - exists only in relationship to underfunctioning
- Involves feeling responsible for others - compelled to manage their well-being
- Involves "doing for" others - compensating for real/imagined deficits
- NOT always obvious - may be subtle "helping" that creates dependence

**What Overfunctioning is NOT**:
- NOT healthy competence - involves doing MORE than appropriate

**Observable Markers - Overfunctioning**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Taking Responsibility | "I have to handle this"; "If I don't do it, no one will" |
| Doing for Others | Completing tasks others should do; stepping in to fix problems |
| Overload Language | "I'm exhausted"; "I'm doing everything"; feeling overwhelmed |
| Advice-Giving | Telling others what to think, feel, do; unsolicited advice |
| Rescuing | Protecting others from consequences; preventing them from struggling |
| Feeling Needed | Deriving worth from others' dependence; "They need me" |
| Complaints about Others | Frustration that others aren't contributing; unsupported |
| Control Behaviors | Managing others' schedules, decisions |

**Critical Insight**: If the overfunctioner becomes unavailable, the underfunctioner
often improves dramatically - they were more capable than the pattern allowed.

---

## UNDERFUNCTIONING - Relationship Mechanism

**Definition**: Underfunctioning refers to a reciprocal relationship position in
which a person feels dependent on another to do things they feel unable to do
themselves. It is NOT inherent incapacity - it is a position.

**Key characteristics**:
- Underfunctioning exists ONLY in relationship to overfunctioning - reciprocal positions
- The underfunctioner feels dependent on others
- Relies on others to do things for them
- At extreme, may rely on others to tell them how to think, feel, and act
- The underfunctioner's true capacity is obscured by the pattern
- If overfunctioner becomes unavailable, underfunctioner often improves dramatically

**What Underfunctioning IS**:
- A reciprocal position - exists only in relationship to overfunctioning
- Involves dependency - feeling dependent on another for what one could do
- Can extend to thinking and feeling - relies on other for how to think/feel/act
- Derives well-being from being ministered to
- Obscures true capacity - underfunctioner may be far more capable than pattern shows

**What Underfunctioning is NOT**:
- NOT inherent incapacity - it's a position in a system; capacity may be much higher
- NOT caused by the underfunctioner alone - overfunctioner participates by taking over
- NOT permanent - can improve dramatically if overfunctioner becomes unavailable

**Observable Markers - Underfunctioning**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Dependency Language | "I can't do this without you"; "I need you to..." |
| Help-Seeking | Asking others to handle tasks within one's capacity |
| Self-Doubt | "I'm not capable"; erosion of confidence |
| Concentration Difficulty | Unable to focus on complex tasks; overwhelmed easily |
| Helplessness | Expressing inability to manage; giving up |
| Feeling Burdensome | "I'm a burden to everyone" |
| Withdrawal | Self-absorbed, isolated, passive |
| Reliance on Directions | Looking to others for how to think, feel, act |

**Pattern Reversal Phenomenon**: When overfunctioner becomes unavailable,
the underfunctioner often improves dramatically - reveals hidden capacity.

---

## PROJECTION - Relationship Mechanism

**Definition**: Projection (Family Projection Process) refers to the process by
which parental focus is intensely directed onto one or more children. It channels
the intensity of the parent-parent relationship through a focus on a child.
The family projection process is universal - exists in all families to some degree.

**Key characteristics**:
- Involves emotional fusion between parent (usually mother) and one or more children
- One child typically receives more intense projection than siblings
- Triangle structure: parents operate as "we-ness" focused on child
- Both parents participate - father typically supports mother's focus
- NOT conscious or intentional - automatic process; parents typically unaware

**What Projection IS**:
- The process by which parental focus is directed intensely to children
- Involves emotional fusion between parent and child - usually mother more intense
- Is NOT evenly distributed among children - one child has more intense fusion
- Is universal - exists in all families to some degree
- Triangle operates even in "calm" marriages

**What Projection is NOT**:
- NOT caused by one parent - both participate; father supports mother's focus
- NOT conscious or intentional - automatic process; parents typically unaware
- NOT always associated with marital conflict - can occur in harmonious marriages
- NOT the same as parental concern - normal concern is reality-based; projection is fusion
- The "projected-on" child is NOT the cause of family problems - child is repository

**Observable Markers - Projection onto a Child**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Focus on One Child | Extensive discussion of one child's problems, different from siblings |
| Worry/Concern Language | "We're worried about X"; preoccupation with child |
| Child as Different | "He's always been special/different/difficult from the beginning" |
| Mother-Child Fusion | Mother's emotions closely tracking child's; can't think clearly |
| Father Supporting Focus | Father agreeing with/supporting mother's concerns about child |
| Attribution | "He's the sensitive one"; "She takes after my difficult uncle" |

**Use Event.child field for the projected-on child.**

---

## INSIDE - Triangle Position

**Definition**: Inside refers to one of two positions in a triangle - the position
of being "in" the emotionally significant relationship at a given moment. A
triangle consists of two "insiders" who are in closer emotional contact with each
other, and one "outsider" who is at greater emotional distance.

**Key characteristics**:
- Inside = closer emotional contact with another person in the triangle
- Inside position can be positive (close, harmonious) or negative (conflict)
- The two inside positions are NOT equivalent - one often more comfortable
- When uncomfortable: insider tries to recruit outsider OR move outside
- Positions shift over time - same person may be inside in one moment, outside in next

**What Inside IS**:
- Closer emotional contact - two are "comfortably close (insiders)" while third distant
- Inside positions are NOT equivalent - discomfort felt more by one than the other
- Uncomfortable insider triangles - pulls outsider in through complaints
- Can be positive or negative - conflict is inside but negative

**What Inside is NOT**:
- NOT static - positions are fluid, shift over time
- Both insiders are NOT equally comfortable - asymmetric experience is typical

**Observable Markers - Inside Position**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Direct Engagement | Speaking directly to/about the other person; emotional intensity |
| Closeness Language | "We're so close"; "We're always together" |
| Discomfort | "I feel crowded"; "I can't breathe"; "I need space" |
| Triangling Attempts | Complaining to outsider about other insider; recruiting |
| Being Topic | Being discussed by the other two (even if not present) |
| Conflict Involvement | Direct conflict with other insider (negative inside) |

**Observable Markers - Movement FROM Inside to Outside**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Distancing | Pulling away from other insider; reduced engagement |
| Complaining to Third | Talking to outsider about the relationship problem |
| Maneuvering | Working to put self in outside position |
| Withdrawal | Emotional or physical withdrawal from intense twosome |

**CRITICAL: Use this for conflicts ABOUT a third party, not conflicts WITH them directly.**

**Use Event.relationshipTriangles for the outside person.**

---

## OUTSIDE - Triangle Position

**Definition**: Outside refers to one of two positions in a triangle - the position
of being at greater emotional distance from the intense twosome at a given moment.

**Key characteristics**:
- Outside = greater emotional distance from the intense twosome
- Outside person may be recruited by uncomfortable insider
- Outside person who remains neutral can allow insiders to resolve tension
- Outside person who takes sides perpetuates the triangle
- Positions shift over time - same person may be outside in one moment, inside next

**What Outside IS**:
- Greater emotional distance from the twosome
- Outsider can be recruited - uncomfortable insider pulls outsider in through complaints
- Neutral outsider allows resolution - if third stays neutral, tension can resolve
- Taking sides perpetuates triangle - outsider who sides with one intensifies process

**What Outside is NOT**:
- NOT static - positions are fluid, shift over time
- NOT the same as cutoff - outside is position within active triangle; cutoff is withdrawal
- Outsider is NOT uninvolved - still part of triangle; affects and is affected by insiders

**Observable Markers - Outside Position**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Distance from Twosome | Not directly engaged in the intense relationship |
| Exclusion Language | "They're so close"; "I'm left out"; feeling on periphery |
| Being Recruited | Receiving complaints from one insider about the other |
| Calm While Others Conflict | Remaining calm when other two are fighting |
| Ability to See Both Sides | Can observe both insiders' perspectives |
| Lower Emotional Investment | Less stake in the outcome of insiders' relationship |

**Observable Markers - Movement FROM Outside to Inside**:
| Category | Indicators (illustrative) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Taking Sides | Agreeing with one insider against the other |
| Getting Triangled | Becoming emotionally invested in the conflict |
| Being Pushed Together | Insiders pushing outsider toward one of them |
| Displacement | Original insider moving out, outsider moving in |

**Therapeutic Principle**: A neutral outsider who stays in contact allows the
conflicting twosome to work out their own issues. Taking sides perpetuates the problem.

**Use Event.relationshipTriangles for the outside person (list of person IDs).**
