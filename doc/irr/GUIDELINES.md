# SARF Coding Guidelines

Rules established from IRR calibration meetings. Updated after each session.

## General Rules

1. **One shift per event, one event per atomic shift.** Each new shift gets a new event entry. Do not use "edit existing event" to append evidence to prior entries. Exception: you can only track one relationship shift per event, so two simultaneous R shifts at the same timestamp require two events.
2. **Two separate shifts for different people.** When a single statement implies events for different people (e.g., Sarah's anxiety vs. mother's diagnosis), code them as separate shifts.
3. **Deduplication.** Same timestamp + same person + same shift = duplicate. Remove one.
4. **First sibling naming → add common parent pair bond.** When text first reveals someone is a sibling, add unnamed shared parents (e.g., "Sarah's mother," "Sarah's father") so both can be linked.
5. **Semantic similarity between description tense and timestamp.** Present-tense descriptions ("Michael doesn't help") should have present-date timestamps. Past-tense ("six months ago") should be backdated accordingly.
6. **Don't change reviewed case data.** Preserve original codings for cases that have been discussed in calibration meetings. Unreviewed cases can be corrected freely.

## Symptom Coding

## Anxiety Coding

## Relationship Coding

### Which RelationshipKind to use

**Minimize assumptions.** When evidence supports multiple mechanisms (triangle, over/under functioning, distance), prefer the code that makes the fewest theoretical assumptions. Toward/away makes fewer assumptions than over/under functioning, which makes fewer than triangle or distance.

- **Away** vs **Distance**: "Away" captures observable reduced involvement. "Distance" implies the specific emotional distance mechanism (anxiety-driven avoidance of content). Use away when you don't have evidence that the avoidance is anxiety-driven.
- **Toward/Away** vs **Over/Under Functioning** vs **Triangle**: When a statement could be coded as any of these, consider which has the most direct textual evidence. Toward/away is the most conservative default. This is an active area of calibration — no definitive rule yet.

### Over/Under Functioning (proposed definition)

Automatic behavior where someone is doing something for another person where there is opportunity to choose differently — "wiggle room." The mechanism is named to point out places where behavior is automatic and adaptive but could potentially be changed. The key test: is there room to consider whether this behavior is necessary?

### Multiple recipients

The data model supports multiple recipients on a single relationship shift. When someone is moving away from or toward multiple people simultaneously, you can code them all as recipients of the same event.

## Functioning Coding

### When to code "up" vs "down" vs "same"

## Edge Cases

### New shift vs reiteration

When a later statement reiterates evidence from an earlier one, it may not warrant a new shift entry. However, if the later statement adds new evidence (e.g., emotional sentiment, new details about the pattern), that may justify a new entry. This is unresolved — use judgment and flag for calibration discussion.
