# Meeting 1: Sarah Round 1 Calibration

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Attendees:** Patrick, Laura, Kathy, Guillermo
**Case:** Sarah
**Statements reviewed:** 1-4

## Disagreements

### Statement 1: "I've been having trouble sleeping and feeling really anxious lately. Things got a lot worse about six months ago when my mom was diagnosed with early stage dementia."

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Patrick | Up (Sarah); Up (mom) | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Laura | Up (Sarah); Up (mom) | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Kathy | — | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Guillermo | Up (Sarah); Up (mom) | Up (Sarah) | — | — |

**Discussion:** Kathy's single entry was a mechanics learning issue. All agreed on two separate shifts.
**Resolution:** Unanimous. Sarah: symptom up + anxiety up. Mom: symptom up (diagnosis). Dates backdated ~6 months.
**Rule:** Two separate shifts when statement implies events for different people.

### Statement 2: "She's okay, I guess...Michael doesn't really help much, and I feel like I'm the one holding everything together."

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Patrick | — | — | Over functioning | — |
| Laura | — | — | Over/under functioning | — |
| Kathy | — | Same | — | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Inside (triangle) | — |

**Discussion:** Central debate: triangle vs over/under functioning vs toward/away. Guillermo couldn't justify triangle in discussion. Laura proposed toward/away as most conservative. Kathy invoked seminar principle of sticking to granular moves. Patrick defined over/under as automatic behavior with "wiggle room."
**Resolution:** No consensus. Tentative convergence on over/under functioning. Toward/away remains viable. Triangle largely abandoned.
**Rule:** Over/under functioning definition proposed: automatic behavior where there's opportunity to choose differently.

### Statement 3: "Michael is my younger brother...it feels like I'm the only one who's really involved with mom right now."

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Patrick | — | — | Structural only (sibling link) | — |
| Laura | — | Up | Inside (triangle) | — |
| Kathy | — | Up | — | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Over functioning (duplicate) | — |

**Discussion:** Debate over whether this is a new shift or reiteration of statement 2. Laura revised to "possibly no new shift." Guillermo proposed flipping: over/under in S2, triangle in S3.
**Resolution:** Unresolved. Agreed on structural data (sibling link, parent pair bond).
**Rule:** First sibling naming → add common parent pair bond. New events for each shift (don't use "edit existing event").

### Statement 4: "Michael has always been a bit more laid back...he's really taken a step back...it frustrates me when I see him not trying."

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Patrick | — | — | Away (Michael from Sarah + mom) | — |
| Laura | — | — | Distance (Michael from mom) | — |
| Kathy | — | — | Distance (Michael from Sarah) + Over functioning | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Over functioning (duplicate) | — |

**Discussion:** Away vs distance debate. Patrick chose "away" to minimize assumptions — distance implies emotional distance mechanism. Disagreement on recipient (Sarah vs mother vs both). Laura's extended argument from weight loss study: end-state shift matters more than statement-level mechanism labels.
**Resolution:** No consensus on mechanism label. Agreement on behavioral direction (Michael less involved).
**Rule:** Prefer away over distance when evidence is ambiguous about emotional distance mechanism. Semantic similarity between description tense and timestamp.

## Rules Established

1. Two separate shifts when statement implies events for different people — added to GUIDELINES.md
2. Over/under functioning: automatic behavior with "wiggle room" to choose differently (proposed)
3. First sibling naming → add common parent pair bond
4. New events for each shift; don't use "edit existing event" to append
5. Minimize assumptions: prefer toward/away over triangle/distance when evidence is ambiguous
6. Semantic similarity between event description tense and timestamp
7. Deduplication: same timestamp + person + shift = remove duplicate
8. Don't change reviewed case data; can change unreviewed cases (Marcus, Jennifer)

## Action Items

- [x] Document rules from this meeting in GUIDELINES.md
- [ ] Patrick: improve IRR dashboard for side-by-side comparison
- [ ] Kathy: fix edit-existing-event usage in Jennifer and Marcus codings
- [ ] All: review primer document before next meeting

## Next Meeting

- Date: 2026-02-23
