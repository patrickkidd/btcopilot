# Meeting 2: Sarah Round 1 Calibration (cont.)

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Attendees:** Patrick, Kathy, Guillermo
**Case:** Sarah
**Statements reviewed:** 1844, 1846

## Disagreements

### Statement 1844: "Michael has always been a bit more laid back...he's really taken a step back...it frustrates me when I see him not trying. It feels like I'm doing everything."

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Patrick | — | — | Away (now disagrees with own code) | — |
| Laura | — | — | Distance (Michael from mom) | — |
| Kathy | — | — | Distance (reversed directionality) + Over functioning | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Over functioning (duplicate) | — |

**Discussion:** Continuation from Meeting 1 Statement 4. Kathy proposed defaulting to toward/away; Patrick pushed back — infrastructure built around mechanism codes. All agreed Sarah's over-functioning appears automatic. Guillermo asked whether Michael's distance is subsumed into over/under functioning pattern.
**Resolution:** Convergence on over-functioning (Sarah) and under-functioning (Michael). Stronger than Meeting 1's tentative convergence. Distance as separate event: bookmarked.
**Rule:** Continue using mechanism-specific R shift codes, not toward/away as default. Automaticity test: ask whether behavior appears automatic/impulsive.

### Statement 1846: "I can't really pinpoint a specific moment...Michael's just avoiding it all. Dad's in Florida with his girlfriend and isn't really involved. Mom...she just seems lost."

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Patrick | — | — | Moved (father) | — |
| Laura | — | S same (mom) | Distance (father from Sarah) | — |
| Kathy | — | — | Distance (combined Michael + father — wrong) | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Distance (father from Sarah) | — |

**Discussion:** Michael's avoidance is reiteration — do not re-enter (deduplication). Father's geographic move vs. emotional distance debated. Geographic distance (divorce, living in Florida) ≠ emotional distance mechanism. "Moved" captures the fact without emotional assumptions.
**Resolution:** Moved for father (convergence). No new entry for Michael (deduplication). Laura's symptom-same for mother not fully discussed.
**Rule:** Prefer "moved" for geographic relocations when emotional distance not evidenced. Deduplication: same person + same shift re-mentioned = no new entry. Preemptively add parents when family member mentioned.

## Rules Established

1. Continue using mechanism-specific R shift codes (over/under, triangle, etc.), not toward/away as default — infrastructure built around these codes
2. Deduplication reinforced: same person + same shift re-mentioned = do not add new entry
3. Exception: re-mention with genuinely different timestamp can be new entry (possibly "same" value)
4. Prefer "moved" over "distance" for geographic relocations without evidence of emotional distance
5. Geographic distance ≠ emotional distance — don't assume one from the other
6. Preemptively add parents: when a family member is first mentioned, add both parents (even unnamed) for pair bond assignment — extends to siblings
7. Person field directionality: "person" = the one doing the action; recipients in separate fields
8. Automaticity test for mechanisms: ask whether the behavior appears automatic/impulsive

## Action Items

- [ ] Patrick: add AI questions to the comparison page
- [ ] Patrick: fix comparison page to reference statements by ID not index
- [ ] Patrick: fix name display bug in comparison page header
- [ ] Kathy/Guillermo: review IRR primer document (required reading)
- [ ] Kathy: look at paper documents from weight loss study timelines for comparison

## Next Meeting

- Date: 2026-03-16 (3 weeks — Patrick traveling week of March 9)
- Attendees: TBD (Laura expected to return)
- Focus: Continue through Sarah statements
- Consider: 90-minute meetings (proposed by Kathy, deferred for now)
