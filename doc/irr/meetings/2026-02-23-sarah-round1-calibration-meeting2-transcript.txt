00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Kathy Jablonski: Hi, Patrick.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Hi Kathy, can you hear me okay?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yes, I can hear your congested self fine.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That's just wonderful.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Kathy Jablonski: Well…

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I think Guillermo is here which is good.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hey!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Hey Guillermo.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: What'd you do to yourself, man?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I got a, I married a teacher.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh, God, that's…

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh…

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That's the risks with education.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, that's… it's a surefire way to just get every virus there is in 2 years, and then you never get another one.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, think of the immunity you're building, man.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Well, she said yesterday she said.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Maybe you should just start coming to the classroom and like touching everybody's pencils like once a week.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Just spend a couple years of just really getting it, getting over it, you know.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Well, I hope I didn't confuse everybody too much about the timing here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Kathy Jablonski: So, you're…

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'm the Florida thing's coming this weekend so my head's full and and then I got a cold and.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: No, it's good.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But but we're here in.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Laura's got an appointment.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Kathy Jablonski: Are you ready for Florida?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, yeah, I could do Florida. I could ad lube a lot of it, honestly, at this point.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah. Oh, Patrick…

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I think.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Kathy Jablonski: And you're doing it… you're doing it from Alaska?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: What were you gonna say Guillermo?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh, if, uh…

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I was gonna say, if we need to touch base before, uh, the weekend, let me know.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, right, I mean, the thing I'm holding you to is the 5 minute intro at least.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh, I got that. Patrick, uh, you know, the guy walks down the mountain from Alaska every morning.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Mhm.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I got your introduction.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, good.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Kathy Jablonski: So I'm… I'm… I'm late, I'm late to this party. Guillermo, is this your meeting? Are you putting it on?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, with, uh, the, the Florida Family Network down here.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Kathy Jablonski: Wow. Okay.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, nice.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It will be cool.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Kathy Jablonski: Getting it out there, getting out there in the stratosphere.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Exactly.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: database, sorry, I'm…

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'm getting all this stuff up here while we're talking.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's just gonna be about.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: All of this, Kathy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I think.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Everything, everything we've been doing.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Except I'm gonna hopefully, I'm gonna, the problem statement I'm gonna throw down there is, is gonna be kind of harsh on the whole therapy world, but.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right, right.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'm gonna try to keep it nice and you know.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: People aren't used to hearing that kind of stuff. The numbers aren't great.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Is that the one we were talking about the other day, Patrick?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Probably, what were we talking about?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: What does the human have to offer?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: No.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: No, it's about just how the field is really fucked up.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: It is…

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That's a harsh way to say it, maybe I won't say it that way. No, I'm just gonna throw down the numbers, how there's more treatment and more money, more resources, more attention, and numbers get worse, so we're in the.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I think…

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We're doing something wrong. That's the problem statement.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That's a great…

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Kathy Jablonski: There's never been a…

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That's a great way to put it.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Kathy Jablonski: I'm not an expert on the subject, but it seems there's never been a priority for.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um, outcomes in… in psychology, in therapy.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a, what do you call it, de Nomo, there's de facto de Nomo in name, there's a.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Priority, you know, at least in clinical psychology, you've.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Every APA accredited program has to use has to train people in evidence-based practices, you know, but there are none.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Really, so that's.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: There's that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: There's that problem.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Anyway, um, that'll be kind of cool.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I gotta do a lot of work this week on it just to tighten it up, but I've got the outlines all there.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, did you guys see…

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The email I sent out, not that I expect you guys to consume everything I send, because I realize there's a lot, but.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Did you see what I put out about the, about how I'm keeping track of all this stuff?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Not that that changes anything we do.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Kathy Jablonski: I don't… I don't recall if I did or not. I saw the email and fully intended to, and now I'm remembering the content. I can't remember if I did or not.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, uh, there is this one landing page and I emailed it out and it's got.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's got this…

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: This dashboard and raw data from like the raw transcripts.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Of what we're saying right now, we'll go into the next transcript.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then it's keeping track of all of our opinions and all of our agreements and disagreements and things like that.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, per meeting.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like by topic.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Kathy Jablonski: Sweet. Sweet.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, and I'm doing this all just kind of theoretically on a theoretical basis, like, theoretically this will all be.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: useful and important. You have to use AI to go through it, because it's too complicated, but it's keeping track of everything we're discussing.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Kathy Jablonski: No.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, that's pretty cool. That's never been done with integrated reliability, I'm sure.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, but last time we were, well, okay, go to the log.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Last time we made it through, there's a statement by statement run through here.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Statement 1…

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Statement 2…

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then this should map into the Sarah.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Discussion, so Sarah's here, this is… let's go to…

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oh, and I have a page that we can use, that's right, I have a page we can use for these meetings now.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So we could see our code side by side per statement.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Kathy Jablonski: Oh, nice!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, AI, man.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Kathy Jablonski: Nice.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I coded that in under an hour.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, according to this, we got through statement… let's just spot check. Statement 2 is she's okay, I guess.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That's amazing.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Kathy Jablonski: Oh my god.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And I need to make it so it's referencing by ID and not in that, yeah, I mean she's okay, I guess, alright, good.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, statement 3…

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Michael's my younger brother…

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Michael's my younger brother…

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, and then it goes through everything we were talking about.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's too much for us to review manually, but that's what the computers are for. So we have statement 4… how many did we get through? Statement 4.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Now for how best to.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Proceed, I mean, I think that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: One of the reasons I'm doing the automated note-taking and basically meeting notes.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: In this way is so that it can free us up a little bit to have more of just a normal conversation.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: About the codes as we go, and just kind of under the assumption that if it tracks everything we have and organizes it point by point and opinion by opinion.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: later on, we'll be able to come back, and I can use AI to analyze all of that, and try to draw some conclusions.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And so I guess the next, I guess for now we can just kind of keep just going through statements.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And just talking about it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And, uh…

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Talking about it and just trying to have fun with it, really, and then maybe after a few more meetings I'll go back and look, I'm not sure.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Kathy Jablonski: It is fun, okay.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, oh, and before we start that, let's see here, so I, there, it should be actually.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I can't remember where it put it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It should be keeping track of, I think it's progress dot MD.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Is this stats or there's some place where it's actually trying to extract the state of our.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: conclusions.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I told it to do that. Primer, workflow meetings, results. There we go.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's gotta be it. So this is just from last meeting, so this will be not that interesting, probably, but it will get more interesting the more we talk.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Measurement open question most or important unresol, let's see, per statement deltas.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: This might not be consumable yet, coding rules, okay.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, so it's trying to put together rules, because this is the kind of stuff that is the outcome of the IRR study.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's the rules, or the manual you give to a future coder.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right? You want to give them… say, here are the rules, here's a case, and then they should come out with the same output as long as they're following the rules.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, it's gonna keep… this is just from that first meeting, it's timestamped to last meeting.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And after this meeting, it will have another one, and it will refine the rules.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So it's an accumulative thing, like that third column is for the case, right? It's an accumulative record.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: One shift per event, one shift for atomic shift, two separate shifts for different people, and one.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Uh, this is too tedious for me to look at, but I just wanted you to show you guys that this is here, and this is the goal.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Makes sense.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, yeah, right.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Makes sense.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Alright, cool.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, so…

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I think it was here, I don't even remember what we were talking about last time.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We could just keep going.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Alright, so this statement is, I don't know, it's hard to say. What was the AI question? We don't have the AI question.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Let's go back here and get the AI question.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I think if I click this it'll jump to the.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, statement 1844…

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We can get the previous AI.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Pause 1844, okay.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure on you, especially feeling like you're the only one stepping up for your mom.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, we were talking about triangles and over-functioning last time. That was kind of the main theme. How has your relationship with… has your relationship with Michael been in the past? Has he always been less involved, or is this a new dynamic since your mom's diagnosis?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And I don't even think we know who Michael is yet, right?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: No. Just that, uh…

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oh.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Kathy Jablonski: We know, yeah, his brother.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh, did we get that already?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yep, Michael is my younger brother in the previous statement, okay.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Kathy Jablonski: His neat brother? Yeah.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh, okay, so we got it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I guess I just don't… this is previous statement, I guess I just don't understand why he can't step up more, he's got a family, but it feels like I'm the only one who's really involved with mom right now.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, feeling, feeling, feeling.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: How has your relationship been with Michael in the past? Has he always been less involved, or is this a new dynamic since your mom's diagnosis?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I don't know, it's hard to say. Michael has always been a bit more laid back, I guess.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But I feel like mom, since Mom's diagnosis, he's really taken a step back. I mean…

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I don't want to blame him completely. Interesting.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Maybe he just doesn't know how to handle it, but it frustrates me when I see him not trying.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It feels like I'm doing everything, and he just isn't.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So just jumping back to… so here's that statement, same statement.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then this is what…

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We coded.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Let's see here, got a lot of info.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So Laura and Kathleen picked out distance.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Guillermo and Kathleen.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Kathy both said over functioning.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: This gets complicated because we have to, it depends on what came right before that, right, for each person.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oh, so Guillermo you, you put over functioning 2 statements in a row.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, I think… I think I'd said last time I would have changed the first one, maybe.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Gotcha.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And you're, you're saying you think that that's Sarah over functioning.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then this person for.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: is Michael, I think. Yeah.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, although there's already 1 in there for Michael, so that's probably just something to correct.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Kathy Jablonski: My thought from last meeting was, um…

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Kathy Jablonski: When in doubt, there's never, toward in a way, if it's described like this, it's never wrong.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Kathy Jablonski: And I harken back to the beginning of the app, when it was, don't make assumptions, you know, go to the granular moves, and…

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Kathy Jablonski: So, I think going forward, I'm probably gonna use that more toward, in a way.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Kathy Jablonski: Until the, until I might decide that there's some real indication of.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Kathy Jablonski: Otherwise, of over under.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um… and I don't… I don't know what that… what that…

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: produces, in terms of… toward in a way, in terms of AI, I mean, the way we were going with the app was.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Kathy Jablonski: These… these cases that would just be toured and away, and then at the end.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Kathy Jablonski: You know, seeing all the arrows and it becoming more clear, and then being able to describe, you know, what happened or what it was, so…

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um, that's just what I'm thinking.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, and you know, so I think if what's in the primer here.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Just about the IRR process.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: This is the the link I sent out is, this is, the goals are in here about how IRR works.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And part of part of the goal.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Is to definitely check this out if you haven't already.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'd say it's required required reading.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Let's see, where did I put this in here?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I can sum it up, just wanna see if it's written.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: code independently, compare, yeah.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, part of, so there's, there's a balancing of separate opinions and, and also converging opinions.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Making opinions converge, agreeing.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So a goal of of this.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Our process is to come up with a consensus.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: On how to do things. So…

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Now, I haven't gone through this process before, so there's nuances and, you know, I think probably when to.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Enforce that, or whatever it is, um, because it's a balance between.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, so you're putting out the opinion right now or the idea that, you know, maybe we.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You could just default to toward an away, as opposed to going into the detail of all the different R shifts.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Sounds like and and then, so that's a new idea.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And, you know, that's… on one hand, you're balancing diversity of opinion, which is on here, because.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That helps us keep this valid when we have lots of different opinions and we consider them all. At the same time, at the end of the day, we have to come up with an agreement.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Otherwise, we can't compare.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So I'm not sure how to handle that right now, I mean, now I'm kind of shifting gears to, to thinking out loud about.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: About how we code versus how AI codes. In the app seminar, up to this point, we've been talking, we've been.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Discussing in the context of how people code this stuff.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: in practice. And AI needs an agreement.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Which is why we're doing IRR, because IRR is about finding an agreement.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, like, Kathy, if you go and do toward and away from now on, and then we're kind of operating on a different rule, then the IRR can't proceed.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But, it's a question, should we just…

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Should we all do it?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know what I mean?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Kathy Jablonski: you're getting… I mean, you know, again, I'm hearkening back to, you know, your original, um, ballads of inductive versus what's inductive, or…

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Mhm.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Kathy Jablonski: And, um, and this is a process to get to some consensus on that. From the two-person reliability study that I took part in with Laura.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Kathy Jablonski: As I recalled, we did it all along.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Kathy Jablonski: Or at least with a number of them, and the way that we settled it.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Kathy Jablonski: Was… if we both were really clear.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Kathy Jablonski: through the discussion that that's what we were… we agreed on going forward. There wasn't… right now, there's more doubt in us about.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Kathy Jablonski: How to proceed with this kind, but the process of discussing it, we did get clear, and it didn't take that long.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Mm-hmm.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Kathy Jablonski: So, I think it was, like, what we did last time, we just needed to keep doing that.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um…

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Kathy Jablonski: With… with just…

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Kathy Jablonski: that…

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Kathy Jablonski: That toss-up between toward and away, you know, never wrong, at what point do you punt to calling it one of the.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Kathy Jablonski: One of the variables.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The way I was thinking about this going into it is that Tord, in a way, kind of gets demoted for this one, and we're starting to make more assumptions.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, and that tournae sort of end up being, I don't even really know what their place was cause I've been operating under.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The opposite route, which is, you know, start making assumptions and then see if they line up.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, I'm thinking big process, big picture wise just with the process is that we have.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, you've gotta, you have to make some decisions up front.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: when designing this stuff.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: without evidence.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's gotta be theoretical, uh, because…

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The pro app, the personal app, the training app, and then all of the backend stuff that has no app.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Uh, all has to be coded before you can even start experimenting, you know, and that takes.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 6 months. Took 6 months.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And so, it's all built around… it's really all built around choosing our shifts, as opposed to torting away.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Kathy Jablonski: See?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: if we started going intoward and away, I mean, yeah, it's true that it's a lower resolution thing that has less assumptions built in.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: At the same time, um…

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: If I had built it all around that, it would have taken a huge technological.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: development period to add any detail, and so I just added it all in there from the beginning, because.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, I, I just had the assumption that, you know, the 4 anxiety binding mechanisms.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The triangle moves and then the and then define self and cut off.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Were pretty good, you know, probably they're pretty simple terms, and that we could probably end up with some agreement on that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And it would be fairly high resolution at the same time.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm, mhm.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, so I don't really know what to do with Tord Inouye right now.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay, so I get it. You're kind of…

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay, so you're kind of shifting from.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Kathy Jablonski: The original, you know.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Kathy Jablonski: So…

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Kathy Jablonski: Intent to just taking the theoretical assumptions of Bowen theory and, and.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Kathy Jablonski: Invalidating or invalidating them with inter-rater reliability.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I had to do that because otherwise I think if we spent time on something as low resolution as torn away, we would never get anywhere.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh, I see.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Considering all of the infrastructure and the flow that's gotta go into it, it's like some assumptions had to be made.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So…

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Those sticking to the shifts, the R shifts.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, yeah, and I mean toward are in there.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, but trying to stay away from them.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I wasn't using them at all.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, like.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: What are you talking about? You got one right there.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oh, oh, I'm the one with the way, oh goll, yeah, that's funny, I don't agree with that now.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like, okay, if I were blind- if I were coding this blindly, just being objective here.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right now, I don't know, it's hard to say because I would, I would build in assumption into this cause I think that's what I would do clinically.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You can tell me what you guys think. If I hear that clinically in, like, I'm actually going to have a current working model in my head that has the assumption that he started over functioning at least more.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Once the diagnosis happened. Or she did.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah. She did.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Or he started underfunctioning and she picked up.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I don't know, that's the assumption I'm gonna act out.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That would be mine, too.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So that's pretty much what you said there, Guillermo.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Kathy…

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Now you're, Kathy, you're putting distance in here.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Sarah distancing from person.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 3 whoever that is, let's look.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, that, um, that… that should be… should be, um, reversed.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, so you're thinking Michael is distancing in that one.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, I think… I think I was early, early in, uh, stuck on who…

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Kathy Jablonski: who the person… I think maybe I was thinking the person who's speaking is the person, um…

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Kathy Jablonski: Is identified as the person, um, but…

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, so when it's… when it says person… person 2, that's who's being distanced, right? So, it's reversed, I have it reversed.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Kathy Jablonski: Can you change… I think maybe the reason I didn't do it was, can you change person once you've entered it?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay. And can you add more than one person in person?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, you can, yeah.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: No.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You, so these other fields you can do more than 1.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because you can… the whole data model has the assumption that it's always one person doing something in relation to others.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: One or more others.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Speaking of assumptions, so you can have 1 person distancing from 3 other people or just one.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, it sounds like the way you would read this now, looking at it, is you would change this to Michael distancing from Sarah.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah. Michael has always been a bit more laid back, but he's really taken a step back. I mean, you know, on his face I could see distance being.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Being coded there.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But I also think you have to do one or the other, you know?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: that goes back to that other rule that the AI picked up, right? One shift per event, or something like that?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oh, actually, that's.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, that's a good point.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That's actually the way that I've been working.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I would agree with that rule. It's, well, not necessarily just, it's not that hard, it's more like only 1.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 1 person can be making, it's like 1 per person per.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Statement, because I think each.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oh, wait, that says per event, not per statement.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Well, I…

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Kathy Jablonski: Well, Sarah, Sarah just had two statements there that were two atomic shifts.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yes.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Kathy Jablonski: That's okay, isn't it?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Well, yeah, well, Kathy, I had a… I guess the question for that one is.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Would distancing be part of the under-functioning, the reciprocity, and.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: The over-under with Sarah.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Kathy Jablonski: In the same entry.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Kathy Jablonski: Well, you couldn't do it in the same entry, but you could do it as an additional entry, right?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: No, no, no, I would…

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: No, I just meant, is him stepping back, taking a big step back, more removed than usual.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Would that be subsumed into the position of under-functioning? Would that be implied?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Kathy Jablonski: Oh. Oh. I mean, that's… I think that's a fair assessment, um, that probably, you know, would… would…

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Kathy Jablonski: Not necessarily 100% of us would always enter, but, um…

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Kathy Jablonski: But on a, you know, on a statement-by-statement basis, potentially, yes.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Kathy Jablonski: I mean, I don't know, yeah.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I… because I see the distance, too, so…

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right, so I did… I did both.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Didn't Laura say something about last week about Dan or somebody else or Bowen saying that there's always.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like, some kind of emotional distance in the mechanisms or something like that.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But also, so, I think both of you, didn't I talk to both of you about when you started?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You, like me, we're really needling through every single little piece of every statement and adding a lot of deltas.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's like intuitive, right? This is kind of reminding me of that.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because I'm thinking at the end of the day when you're done with a session and you go back to it 5 days later, not that you ever do that, but.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, you go back and review, maybe you're gonna see the person again.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You need to have like a scan.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Of the, the Cliffs notes of what matter, right?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because you can only handle so much in your head when you go into a session.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You need to have the basics of what was said and it feels like this level of detail gets to be too much, you know.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Kathy Jablonski: I guess that's a really good point, because I've mused about what all does AI need to hear or know about with these entries.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Kathy Jablonski: So I've been over… yeah, I've been leaning in the… in the overdoing it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, yeah, and humans and AI consume things differently, you know, the notes that I've got on these sessions are verbose.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because that's all machine consumable. We will never read all of this.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And so, there is a little bit of a difference, but at the same time, the main goal for this is to make it so that you can hand somebody a personal app.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: a new client. They can chat with it for a while, and then you can give a human.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Something that is easily consumable. It's got a timeline with the basic themes, and it's got the diagram.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, you know, and then maybe after that, I don't know how it's gonna work, but maybe after that the, the machine consumable level of detail may.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Have a place.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But right now, I'm… well, and if it's an integrated reliability study, and we're having these… these meetings, we're speaking on a human level here, because we have to have a…

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We have to have an agreement on rules that humans follow.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So I guess we just have to proceed at the human level.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Kathy Jablonski: Before I forget, are you going to tell us before we part today about how to access this page?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: For now.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Kathy Jablonski: No, yeah.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, it's also in the email I just sent last week after our last meeting, so…

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, anyway, let's see here, probably running on our time limit for this statement.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, but we all, I mean, looking back with glazed eyes, we all have this.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We all pretty much agree on the over functioning part of this so far. It's like, we're getting into the details of which statement.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But we agree that he is doing less, and she is compensating.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And do you guys think that that's automatic?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Cause that's what a mechanism is, it's automatic, you know, like she's just kind of doing it out of impulse.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I think so, too.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: It seems to be that way.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay. And the distance thing is interesting.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Maybe we can bookmark it.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Alright, moving on, just for the sake of moving on.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I can't really pinpoint a specific moment, oh, what was the AI, I need to put the AI messages on that page.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, it sounds like… he's always saying that, this situation has really shifted your dynamic with Michael.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Has there been any specific moment or event that stands out to you that may have contributed to this change in his involvement? That's kind of a dumb question, because she said since the diagnosis, but…

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: This is a simulation, so…

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And how are your parents handling the situation together? That's a good question.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That's a great question.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That's a great question.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I can't really pinpoint a specific moment, but I feel like things have just gotten worse since Mom's diagnosis.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So repeat, right?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's like Michael's just avoiding it all. As for my parents, well, Dad's in Florida with his girlfriend and.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And it isn't really involved at all and mom.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: She just seems lost, which makes it harder.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So did we have…

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We had, oh, cause she was mother was in there from the diagnosis from the beginning.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But this is the first time she mentioned dad and dad's girlfriend, right?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Or at least… at least the dad's girlfriend.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I believe both of them, though.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, and oh, you know, I remember there is 1 rule that we should probably just decide.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: A coding rule. It has to do with when you add parents.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Kathy Jablonski: Hmm.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, I don't think it matters, we just, there's like 2 choices, so when you.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Kathy Jablonski: Same question.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And we have to pick one. So, I think it's, like, the rule… the choices are, when the first time some… a parent is mentioned, do you just add both?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Or do you actually wait for.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um…

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Both to be named, or something like that.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like, here we've got mother of Sarah on the first one, but no father of Sarah.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But even to set parents, which we have to do.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's like that's the mother, so you gotta be able to set her, you have to have both.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Kathy Jablonski: Can you put them side by side again, the four of us?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, and this is for…

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 1840.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Isn't they just the next one.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's the second one.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Oh, second one.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So…

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I added Sarah's mother in the beginning.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, my mom, so actually that, so here the, we do, the, the my mom part, she does need to be added at least, the mother.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So that you can attach a symptom shift, right?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because that's what the dementia is.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: A diagnosis. And then the question is, do we… because we know that's her mom, and we want to set up that relationship, because that's how the diagram is built out, it's all based on parabonds and offspring.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, do we just add in the parents first?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like both parents in order to be able to sign the pair bond as the parents.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And I'm kind of leaning that way.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Kind of like just having Sarah's mom, Sarah's dad.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: When you get more information, you can edit that little thing later.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, like, don't we get her name later.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah. Or if you get… or if you get, like, a death date, or a birth…

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, I think that's what I did with Richard, Sarah's father, yeah.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That makes sense to me, Patrick, that way of doing it.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, and I think that that would fit with the way the Pro app works now, where when you add a birth event, it adds the parents.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Which is kind of clunky but.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yep.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, all right, so that's, that's a good rule, so the AI will catch that and not take it, I bet.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Let's see if it does that later.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, so back to this, um…

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: So, Patrick, that would be with anybody who's in the family, would, like, as soon as we enter Michael, we'd enter Michael's parents and Michael's.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Kathy Jablonski: Michael's mother and Michael's father.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, basically you add anyone that's implied, maybe is the rule, in terms of parentage.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Kathy Jablonski: Or sibling.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because if… one thing I figured out, this is an aside, one thing I figured out in designing the data model is everything comes down to pair bonds and offspring. That's what sets up the diagram.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And so, when you're… an example is…

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: when you know that Sarah has a mother, you know she has a father, and you have to have a pair bond to assign as parents. You can't just say.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: This is Sarah's mother.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, because the field is parents, plural.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Under person, right? So then, if you know there's a mother, you can just add the father and then.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Say that that pair bond is her parents.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But then, it's the same thing with a sibling.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: If you know a person has a sibling, then you know they have the same parent, so you can add the parent pair bond that way, too, and then assign the pair bond as the parents to both people.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And that's all you need for a family diagram.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, so we'll kind of preempt it… so the rule is preemptively add parents.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, that's good.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Oops.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So then back to this, we were saying, I can't, she's saying when did that change, and then also, or the AI said when did that change, and how.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Has he always…

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Is it this one? Right.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Sorry, 1844, that was the one we prefer when we start on.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Has there been any specific moment or event that stands out to you that may have contributed to this change or involvement, and how are your parents handling this situation? And then…

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Survey sets.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You like that? 1846.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I did, Patrick.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Family Feud.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Survey says… I can't really pinpoint a specific moment, so that's where we're at here, right.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So then we've got the dad and the girlfriend.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: There's a lot here.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Michael's avoiding it all, okay.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Distance under functioning, who knows? As for my parents, well, dad's in Florida with his girlfriend and isn't really involved.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And Mom, she's just lost.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, Guillermo's first, Kathy, Laura.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, then me.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So Guillermo.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Kathy Jablonski: I can see right there. Yeah, go ahead, sorry.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: No, you, I don't know where to start with this, there's a lot here, what were you thinking?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Kathy Jablonski: I was thinking, I can see that I crammed two different, um, data points into one entry, the di… the Michael avoiding and dad in Florida, so there should be two different.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: Entries, right, two different shifts.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And you're… this one, second column.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Kathy Jablonski: So that, right there, where it says description, and I have all that.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Kathy Jablonski: And I…

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Since Michael's a good boy, yeah.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And it seemed so we, we already have.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Michael avoiding. Covered.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So then, we don't need to add new…

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: New deltas, because it's mentioned again.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Kathy Jablonski: Really, even though she's associating it with a double whammy of both of them are…

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Kathy Jablonski: At a distance.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Well, the shift…

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The shift, the shift there is that Michael has stopped becoming involved with mother.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Or something, or whatever. Stepped away from involvement with mother's diagnosis, right?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Kathy Jablonski: We discussed this last time, didn't we say that every time it's mentioned we enter it? No?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: No, no. No, and actually, yeah, the rule for this… for the thing is that you only want to add it in there once, because otherwise it's going to create a new event.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: No.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And you're gonna end up with duplication in the right-hand column going down.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: time.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay, so Michael's distancing one time.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: One time.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah. Kathy, I think you were right.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So it's 1 person doing 1 thing, and whenever it's mentioned again, you know, you just, you use the same shift, because it's one shift in time by a person.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right? That's a good rule.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: There's a bug that is not mentioning these names, but it is mention, it is showing those in the.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Over here, so I think this is your.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: It shows them… yeah, it shows them in there.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, so it's something to fix.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So… and then you've got the over functioning in here, feels like I'm doing everything, and that kind of gets back to the same…

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Thing we were talking about before.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's just that you're coding it at a later time.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Kathy Jablonski: It's just redundant, okay.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, and I don't really know how to resolve that. There may, because I've noticed that there's a little drift from statement to statement. I can see some opinion.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Differences in opinion about when to code something.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like, uh, maybe it's in this statement, maybe it's in the next statement, maybe it's in the next statement, like for this over-functioning thing.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And that which is why I've been thinking about comparing the cumulative notes at the end instead of statement by statement.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because we may not be able to come up with a rule for that.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: For when to mention the over functioning, you know what I mean?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Kathy Jablonski: Well, it…

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Kathy Jablonski: In the weight study, it was, you know, just that kind of straightforward, relevant or not relevant, underline relevant text, so…

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Kathy Jablonski: It would have been underlined every time it's mentioned.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Kathy Jablonski: You know, Michael's avoiding Michael's distancing, and then when you look over the whole timeline.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: It does, it does sort of, um…

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Kathy Jablonski: flow into a certain time more when that was building, it was mentioned more, it was, it was contributing to the assessment of the.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Kathy Jablonski: Of the individual's anxiety, it was contributing to the, the, uh.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Kathy Jablonski: evaluator being more convinced this was really an anxiety data point, and then it made it more evident the moment that it shifted, if it did.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um, I don't know what, you know, to do with that, except… except it's consistent with what you just said, that the full.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Kathy Jablonski: You know, the full story transcript is important.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That's really interesting.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Actually.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because there is a statement by statement aspect to what you said, and there's also the holistic.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: View aspect, it's like a 2 pass.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right. The holistic, the holistic.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Kathy Jablonski: And this was such an advantage of going backwards in time. All these people had in common that they had had symptom resolution, so there was this hypothesis about a shift, so it was already sort of preloaded that that's the lens through which this data was being evaluated, how, when.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Kathy Jablonski: Who did it happen? And, um, so that…

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Kathy Jablonski: Relevant, not relevant, was… was very important.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um, and that'll probably more be the case when we're, when we're doing this with clinical cases where there has been a shift.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Kathy Jablonski: Maybe it'll be more apparent.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Well, right now, I'm just thinking about what you said, that's really interesting how you laid it out the way you guys did it, so.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right now, I can already see after we're like 6 statements in.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That…

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We, the way, like, we've seen this over-functioning thing and I'm starting to get to the point where, okay, you mentioned overfunctioning.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You got there and that's kind of the point, you know, it's like all the coders got there.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then we just kind of skip it. If I see it again somewhere, I just, probably not that.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Important that it happened now as opposed to two statements before.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But what is really important is, like, if somebody coded that, you know, through a conflict in there and that stands out.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'm just thinking about how to kind of roll with it a little bit as we go.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Anyway.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Kathy Jablonski: I'm gonna go back and look at some of the, um…

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Kathy Jablonski: You know, the paper… the paper documents of these timelines, the actual transcript and the underlined relevant text.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: I just, I think it would be interesting with this conversation to.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Kathy Jablonski: Look at them. Maybe you want to look at one, yeah. Or two.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Alright, well, let's keep moving. This is interesting. So there's this idea of…

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Just sort of smoothing out all of the.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: The values here, um.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay, so Laura put in a distance there with, uh, with the father.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And… nobody else caught that one, I don't know if he's person 4.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Uh, I have it down below, Patrick, my second one.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I need to make my screen a little bit.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: There we go.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Which one are you? You're the first column? Second one. Sarah's dad distance, yeah.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah, I got it.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, I didn't put that in here, I just put moved.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Sarah's, and then Kathy, you put user.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: User doing.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: distance.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You were thinking that the user that Sarah is distancing from, I guess this is probably.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Let's look cause I have you up here.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 1846, right?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 1846.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: From Michael and their father so you, you had Sarah distancing from them.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, that was my same error of who gets entered in the person, the distance… not the distancer… the distancer, yeah, so it'd be Michael. So there, I couldn't do it that way, because I couldn't enter two people, so it would have to be two entries.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Do you, what you would do is Michael and their father distancing from Sarah.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: So, yeah.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Kathy Jablonski: But if… but if I can't enter two people under person, I would do it as two separate entries, correct?

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Right, yeah, technically, yeah.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Kathy Jablonski: And really, I don't know that I would do it that way, because the father is geographically distant.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Kathy Jablonski: It's a divorce, is he really distancing?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That's a good question.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Kathy Jablonski: He's just… he's just away, um, so I don't know that I would conclude emotional distance. I mean…

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Kathy Jablonski: That's sort of baked in with a divorce, but, um, that…

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um, isn't really an acute thing. So, if I had that to do over, I'd put Michael…

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Kathy Jablonski: Well, I might not put anything if we're gonna agree we don't enter it more than once, um…

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Kathy Jablonski: But I probably would because she grouped them together as important to her in terms of how it's piling on her. So I'd put Michael as the person, um…

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Kathy Jablonski: emotional distance, or distance, um, Sarah, distancing Sarah would be the distanced person, and then…

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Kathy Jablonski: I would enter a separate entry with, um…

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Kathy Jablonski: father as the distancer. Am I imagining this, or was there something here in here about geographical distance?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Well, it says Dad's in Florida.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Kathy Jablonski: Something in the… in the coding, though, no?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: We don't…

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: No, there's no codes that you can add for that, there's just moves.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Kathy Jablonski: Moves, like, a geographic move? No, just… uh-huh.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, and actually, I'm thinking about getting rid of that one.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Kathy Jablonski: The geographic move?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But, yeah.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Kathy Jablonski: then maybe that's what I'm thinking of. Would I have seen that?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I actually, that's the way I coded this, I only did move.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Kathy Jablonski: Oh, moved.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I think that might be the right thing, Patrick, if we already have, uh…

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: if we had previous distance for Michael, and…

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: like Kathy's saying, I don't know how factual it is that there's emotional distance there.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: With the dead.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, I can see for this one, I, I wanted to get that he did move.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, that the dad moved.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And I, I was for some reason, and I can't explain why I'm choosing a lot of these things, I just felt like.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I didn't want to make assumptions with that statement for some reason.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: About the emotional setup, it's just like, he got married, he moved.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And, you know, okay, like you said, like you.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: There's emotional distance, I guess, baked in with divorce. It's also… there's some… there's less involvement baked in with the geographical move.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, I mean, I don't, I don't know that it's baked in with, the distance part was baked in with the divorce, that's a, that's a deep question in my opinion.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Um, but I don't think that that comes up in this statement.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Kathy Jablonski: Mm-hmm.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So, anyway, I just put moved in there.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right. Yeah, yeah, I think that's… I like that.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I also kind of, you know, these are synthetic conversations, but I think, like, if any of the 3 of us were watching.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I wonder if we would circle around to that, or speaking instead of the AI. I wonder if we would circle around back to that again.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: To get more detail to fill in those assumptions.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, you have to know what the emotional configuration is between all these people. Like, there was a divorce.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You gotta know a whole bunch of stuff about that.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Ideally, was it bad? Do they talk, you know?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: What are the triangles?

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Kathy Jablonski: Oh, if one of us was Sarah, you mean?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: If one of us was the actual coach here.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Kathy Jablonski: Oh.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Kathy Jablonski: For sure.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then Laura put symptoms same, she said confusion.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: For…

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: As for my parents, she just seems lost. I guess that maybe that's what she.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Meant by that.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Symptoms same.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Kathy Jablonski: Person 2, is that mom?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's gotta be, let's.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Let's see here…

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Get Laura's up.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Symptoms same Sarah's mother confusion.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Hmm.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'll tell you, it's too bad Laura's not here to speak up for this one. The way I've been thinking about the same.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Value for symptom anxiety functioning is…

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Is it's when you got a data point that it was the same.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's… so you can tell, you know, you got a data point, something got worse at this point.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And then, if you don't have any data.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You have to make assumptions about what's going on in there if you don't have any data for like the next 3 weeks and then there's a shift down in a symptom after a shift up.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: 3 weeks before you kind of fill in automatically assumptions about what's going on in the middle.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And you have to sort of decide whether you assume it's the same or has gone down.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, but if you put.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I just always thought his symptoms same as.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: We actually had some confirmation that it was the same there, as opposed to falling back to baseline.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Which is another thing you could assume.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Kathy Jablonski: Would that be a way to deal with the… would that be a way to deal with the, um, regular mentions of Michael avoiding and distancing, that you'd enter the distance once, and then you'd just enter it again and say same, same, same?

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Fine.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: If the additional same codes came with a different.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Timestamp.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right. Yeah.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That's the point.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because if it's the same time, if she keeps talking about how he just.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: You know, stopped helping during mom's diagnosis, then it's the same time, it's the same shift, you've only got 1 shift.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh, uh…

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But if it's like, oh, and you know, about 2 months later, you know, he had a period where he helped a little bit.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Kathy Jablonski: Uh-huh.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Then I would say, you know, the.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: That was different and I would, I don't know how I would quote that, but.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Kathy Jablonski: Or, I took all care of all the funeral arrangements, and Michael didn't help, that would be another entry.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Kathy Jablonski: Another distance.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I guess so.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Ugh, yeah.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But if you got, well, just to keep it simple with symptom, if you got a report that said, yeah, it's, you know, I haven't slept well, like for me, it's always sleeping.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like, oh, really got bad in high school and it's been the same ever since. You know, I might put a couple sames in there over the next couple years, but I say, like, no, I just have these acute spikes.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Then it returns to baseline in the middle. I wouldn't put same anyway.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I don't know, my brain's not clear enough to explain this, what I'm thinking here.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I think you explain it.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Kathy Jablonski: I'll follow you.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: There's a… there is a thing for same, it's like, when you get… I think when you get a report on a different timestamp than another shift for symptom, for example, they say, yeah, it was the same as when it started.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Good.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: And they're talking about 2 months after the initial onset, you would actually add that in as a symptom, same.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Because now you have a second data point.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Mm-hmm.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Anyway…

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: That makes sense. Well, guys, I have to run, go… I have to go teach.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Kathy Jablonski: I mean, I'm confident that this is… this is just, you know, we're just getting our chops on.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Kathy Jablonski: And there… it's gonna, it's gonna… it's gonna happen where we… we just have a lot more clarity when we do these, and… and uh… so, I think this is, you know, these are good discussions, even though.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I love it.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I just, uh… I wish I didn't have to leave.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Good.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah, I know.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It's really cool.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Kathy Jablonski: I… I'm wondering if we should… I wonder if we… if… if what people think about make… trying to make these…

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I agree with you, Kathy.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Kathy Jablonski: Um, 90 minutes.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: I'd be open to it, I just have to find the right time, that's all.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Kathy Jablonski: Right, right. You do it on your lunch hour, Patrick?

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: More or less, yeah, I'd like to keep it an hour, but I have been wondering about that. Let's, let's try it at 1 hour.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Kathy Jablonski: Yeah.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Like, a couple more times and see how it goes, how about? But I think it's a good question.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Okay.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Kathy Jablonski: Do we have a new date?

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: It'll be 2 weeks from now.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Alright.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: So that was actually the originally scheduled, so that's the 9th, can you, or no, I'm sorry, it's.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: I'm gonna be gone then, so it would be the 16th, that's what we had before, does that still work?

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: It's 3 weeks.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Kathy Jablonski: Okay, right, right, yeah.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Sounds good. Alright, guys, I gotta run. I'll see you… I'll see you soon.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Okay.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Kathy Jablonski: I'll look forward to seeing you both… I'll look forward to seeing you both on the podium.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Guillermo Cancio-Bello: Yeah! Patrick, I'll see you soon!

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: Yeah, so to speak, okay, talk to you later.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Kathy Jablonski: Alright, bye.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Dr. Patrick Stinson: But…
