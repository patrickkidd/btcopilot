**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Attendees:** Patrick (facilitator), Kathy, Guillermo, Laura
**Case:** Sarah
**Statements reviewed:** 1-4 (of the Sarah case transcript)
**Facilitator:** Patrick

## Cross-Cutting Themes

**1. Triangle vs. Over/Under Functioning vs. Toward/Away — Coding Ambiguity**

The central methodological tension across multiple statements was how to code evidence of relational patterns when the textual evidence supports multiple theoretical mechanisms simultaneously. Guillermo initially coded triangle (inside/outside) for Statement 2 but could not justify it in discussion and said he would have preferred over/under functioning. Laura coded over/under functioning but acknowledged the triangle was "probably there." Kathy invoked the seminar principle of sticking to granular moves (toward/away) rather than making assumptions about higher-order mechanisms. Laura proposed the most conservative approach: code only toward/away moves, which avoid premature conclusions about whether the pattern is triangling, over/under functioning, or something else. Patrick argued that over/under functioning was "easy to write a rule for" on its face. No clean resolution was reached — the group bookmarked this as an ongoing question. Guillermo later proposed a heuristic for distinguishing between mechanism codes: ask whether a therapeutic follow-up question relevant to the coded mechanism would be appropriate for the client. "If you're marking it over functioning, would the therapeutic question that's relevant to that be something about over functioning? And if you're marking it a triangle, would the relevant question be about a toward or away move?" Patrick endorsed this as matching his own reasoning process: "I think that's how I arrived at that triangle, at the sentiment... What is missing? What's in here and what's missing? What would I need to know for it to actually be absolutely sure that it's a triangle?" Guillermo noted: "there might be something in there about training the AI too." (Lines 310-318)

**2. Minimize Assumptions — Prefer Lower-Inference Codes**

Across Statements 2-4, the group converged toward a principle of minimizing assumptions in coding. Patrick explicitly chose "away" over "distance" for Michael in Statement 4, reasoning that "away" has fewer built-in assumptions than "emotional distance," which implies a specific mechanism. Laura's toward/away proposal for Statement 2 carried the same logic. Kathy noted that "towards and away are always kind of more factual." Guillermo endorsed this: "To minimize assumption, I think is a good rule." The principle: when evidence is ambiguous between multiple mechanisms, default to the code that makes the fewest theoretical assumptions.

**3. Statement-Level Granularity vs. End-State Validity**

Laura raised a recurring point rooted in her prior IRR work with Kathy on the weight loss study: what ultimately mattered was whether a shift occurred and whether it affected anxiety or functioning — not the specific mechanism label applied at each statement. She argued that coders can reasonably code individual items differently yet reach the same holistic conclusion. Patrick acknowledged the tension but noted that AI training requires explicit, mechanistic rules at the statement level, creating a conflict between the pragmatic approach (end-state evaluation) and the requirements of the technical pipeline (statement-by-statement delta extraction). This remained unresolved but was acknowledged as a fundamental design tension. Laura provided empirical evidence from her prior work: after iterating on the weight loss study methodology with Kathy, she was eventually able to "run a little study with the network group and asked them to do it on a specific case and could give clear enough instructions to get a comparison between people" — demonstrating that this iterative calibration process can mature into transferable methodology. Kathy described their evolving method: first determining if a part of the transcript was "relevant or not" (yes/no), then examining what the relevant shifts led to in terms of anxiety and functioning changes — "those were the variables." Laura also asked whether the statistics account for corrections over time (line 193); Patrick responded he was developing the dashboard and considering shifting measurement from statement-level to end-state: "that level of granularity may be too high because there's so much variation... should I shift towards really just measuring the end state? Because the end state is really what matters." (Lines 193-200, 391-416)

**4. Vertical Alignment — Rules Must Work Across IRR, AI Training, and Apps**

Patrick introduced the concept of "vertical alignment" — that coding rules established in calibration meetings must simultaneously satisfy: (a) inter-rater reliability for potential publication, (b) AI training data requirements for the extraction model, and (c) the data model and UX of the Pro and Personal apps. This constraint was cited as the reason that seemingly academic distinctions (e.g., triangle vs. over/under vs. toward/away) matter operationally: the AI needs explicit, rule-based guidance, not implicit clinical judgment. Patrick elaborated that the AI system prompt is "extremely long now" and "almost all examples," with the hard work being to get the training dataset "as short but as comprehensive as possible." He framed coding rules as becoming "implicit in the examples in the data as training data" — meaning the IRR calibration directly produces the data that teaches the AI extraction model. (Line 224) This theme surfaced in Statements 2 and 4 and during the closing meta-discussion.

**5. New Events vs. Edit Existing Event — Operational Confusion**

Kathy revealed in Statement 3 discussion that she had been using "edit existing event" extensively in her coding of Jennifer and Marcus, associating subsequent evidence with prior events rather than creating new atomic shift events. The group clarified that the correct approach is to create a new event for each shift, with "edit existing event" being rarely used. Guillermo provided the conceptual frame: "from a macro level it looks like one shifting thing, but on a micro level, it's small atomic shifts over time which are independent but linked." This was a significant operational correction for Kathy's coding practice.

**6. Multiple Patterns Operating Simultaneously**

Laura articulated that the emotional system expresses multiple patterns at any given moment, meaning evidence in a single statement can reasonably support several different mechanism codes. This was her rationale for arguing that statement-level disagreement may not indicate real disagreement — just different foci on the same systemic process. Guillermo echoed this by citing Bowen's assertion that "emotional distance is part of every mechanism."

**7. Learning Curve and Throwaway Cases**

All four coders acknowledged that Sarah was their first case and that their coding improved with subsequent cases (Marcus, Jennifer). Kathy explicitly noted she was still learning the mechanics during Sarah and was not yet thinking about inter-rater reliability — "I sort of took up the mantle of your video that you made of just get the mechanics down." Kathy even suggested starting with a later case since she was "the crudest and the most unskilled" during Sarah (line 132). Patrick stated his expectation that Sarah would be a "throwaway" case, with the question being whether Marcus and Jennifer will also smooth out. Guillermo confirmed: "I started getting better after Sarah." Laura noted she finished Sarah coding the night before the meeting, returning to it "a half a dozen times over a month." This context frames the initial positions as heavily influenced by familiarity with the tooling rather than purely by clinical judgment.

**8. Kathy's Two-Pass Worksheet Method**

Kathy described a coding methodology discovery from her later cases (Jennifer): instead of coding directly into the editor statement by statement, she first went through the entire transcript and created a separate document with columns for the timestamp on that part of the transcript and then "the coding, the people, the event, and the moves that I was going to — in the SARF, what SARF things I was going to enter." She then did a second pass entering everything into the coder. She reported this both improved her thinking ("not only could I think about it better") and was "so much faster." Patrick confirmed: "you took notes as you went so you could do a second pass with the coder." The group did not discuss adopting this as standard practice, but it represents a potential efficiency improvement for the coding workflow. (Lines 34-39)

**9. Agreement vs. Validity Balance — Bowen Parallel**

Patrick framed the meeting's overarching purpose as balancing two competing goals: agreement (mechanical IRR convergence through discussion and rule-making) and validity (ensuring agreement is on the right thing through collective intelligence — diverse independent opinions). He drew an explicit parallel to Bowen family therapy: "when you're coaching a family, that family has to make decisions together, they have to have some agreement, but you also have to have the plurality of opinion." He noted the consultation seminar tradition operated under this same principle: "Bowen was very attuned to where people have their own opinions and you're trying not to over agree." Patrick also acknowledged the conformity risk: "I've worked more than anybody on operationalizing this stuff and I've probably burnt more mental calories on it. It's really easy to agree with me on that." (Lines 119-130)

**10. Historical Precedent — Dan Papero's Wish for Structured Conceptual Conversations**

Laura recalled a conversation with Dan Papero from early days at the Bowen center: "what he said was, I wish we could do more of that — talk about, you know, is this distance or is that cutoff or how do you actually in a disciplined way conceptualize what occurred in this case." Laura described the current meeting as "a unique thing to be having this conversation." Patrick agreed: "this is the kind of thing that has to happen. You've got to have the infrastructure, the tooling helps with that, the vision, the plan... I never saw anything like that when I was at the Bowen center. And that's why I thought this needed to happen." This positions the IRR calibration work as addressing a long-standing gap in the Bowen theory community — structured, disciplined conversations about how to conceptualize clinical patterns. (Lines 425-428)

**11. Data-Level vs. Evaluation-Level Assumptions**

Patrick articulated an architectural principle separating two layers: the raw coding data (which should minimize theoretical assumptions) and the evaluation pass (where theoretical assumptions are applied to interpret patterns). He stated: "one of the strengths of the approach that we're doing here is it tries to lay down a data model that has fewer of the evaluation level assumptions — just to kind of try to capture them separately — so that the data has less assumption baked in before you do the evaluation pass." This principle supports the minimize-assumptions coding approach (Theme 2) at a structural level and explains why the group aims for low-inference codes (toward/away) in the data even when higher-inference interpretations (triangle, over/under) may be clinically appropriate during evaluation. (Line 405)

## Statement 1: "I've been having trouble sleeping and feeling really anxious lately. Things got a lot worse about six months ago when my mom was diagnosed with early stage dementia."

### Initial Positions

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Kathy | — | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Guillermo | Up (Sarah's mom — diagnosis); Up (Sarah) | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Laura | Up (Sarah); Up (Sarah's mom) | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Patrick | Up (Sarah); Up (Sarah's mom) | Up (Sarah) | — | — |

Note: Kathy coded only one entry (anxiety up for Sarah) because she was still learning the mechanics and did not realize she could enter multiple events per statement.

### Coder Reasoning

**Kathy:** Coded anxiety up for Sarah. Stated she "wasn't thinking inter rater reliability" at this point — she was focused on learning the mechanics of the coding tool. She acknowledged she would now code two separate entries: symptom (trouble sleeping) + anxiety up for Sarah, and symptom for Sarah's mother (diagnosis), with the mother's event backdated approximately six months.

**Guillermo:** Coded two separate shifts — one for Sarah's mom (diagnosed with early stage dementia, symptom up) and one for Sarah (symptom and anxiety, trouble sleeping and feeling anxious). Used coding date rather than backdating six months. He acknowledged the dates were just coding date, not intentional timestamps.

**Laura:** Coded the same two-shift structure as Guillermo. Backdated the events approximately six months before the discussion date, matching the "about six months ago" reference in the statement.

**Patrick:** Coded the same two-shift structure. Sarah: trouble sleeping, symptom up, anxiety up. Sarah's mom: diagnosed with early stage dementia, symptom up. Backdated six months, matching Laura's approach.

### Deliberation

**Presentation order:** Patrick reviewed each coder's entries sequentially: Kathy, Guillermo, Laura, then his own.

**Key arguments:**
- Patrick noted that Laura and he were "effectively the same codes" with two separate events and backdated timestamps
- Guillermo's codes matched in substance but used coding date instead of backdated timestamps — he confirmed this was simply an omission, not a substantive disagreement
- Kathy explained her single entry was a learning-phase artifact, not a clinical judgment — she confirmed she would now code it as two separate shifts

**Evidence cited:**
- The statement itself provides clear textual markers: "trouble sleeping" (symptom), "feeling really anxious" (anxiety), "about six months ago" (timestamp), "mom was diagnosed" (separate person's event)

### Position Evolution

No meaningful position shifts occurred. Kathy acknowledged she would now code two entries rather than one, but framed this as a mechanics learning issue rather than a change in clinical interpretation.

### Resolution

**Final coding:**

Two separate shifts:
1. Sarah — symptom up (trouble sleeping), anxiety up, dated approximately six months before discussion date
2. Sarah's mom — symptom up (diagnosis of early stage dementia), dated approximately six months before discussion date

| | S | A | R | F |
|-|---|---|---|---|
| Sarah | Up | Up | — | — |
| Sarah's mom | Up | — | — | — |

**Unanimity:** Unanimous (once Kathy's mechanics issue was accounted for)
**Confidence:** High

### Ambiguity Signal

Brief — quick agreement with minimal discussion. Variation was attributable to learning curve, not clinical disagreement.

### Rules Established

- Two separate shifts when a statement implies events for different people (Sarah's anxiety vs. mother's diagnosis)
- Date certainty: "about six months ago" maps to an approximate date backdated from the discussion reference date (12/17)

### Cross-Statement Connections

- The two-person shift structure (Sarah + Sarah's mom) recurs as a baseline throughout subsequent statements
- Kathy's learning-curve coding pattern (single entry, coding date) is a factor in later statements as well

## Statement 2: "She's okay, I guess...Michael doesn't really help much, and I feel like I'm the one holding everything together. It's just exhausting, honestly."

### Initial Positions

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Kathy | — | Same | — | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Inside (triangle: Sarah toward mom, Michael outside) | — |
| Laura | — | — | Over/under functioning (Sarah over, Michael under) | — |
| Patrick | — | — | Over functioning (Sarah for Michael) | — |

Note: Kathy coded anxiety same (not up) — still in mechanics learning phase. She later stated she would now code over/under functioning.

### Coder Reasoning

**Kathy:** Coded "exhausted by mom's confusion and forgetting, Michael doesn't help" with anxiety as same. Explained she was still in learning mode: "I wasn't even thinking really that much about the purpose of it, which is the moves and the SARF." When asked how she would code it now, she said she would include over/under functioning. She also invoked the seminar principle: "I was just hearkening back to seminar at the very beginning of it and kind of the goal to stick to the granular moves like toward, in a way and to not make assumptions about descriptors like under functioning, over functioning."

**Guillermo:** Coded triangle — Sarah moving inside toward her mother, Michael on the outside. Explained: "I think I initially wanted to put over under functioning, but I felt like it was more of an assumption. So I think I was trying to find a way to get as concrete as I could." In discussion, he acknowledged he could not fully justify the triangle coding and said he would now lean toward over/under functioning instead.

**Laura:** Coded over/under functioning — Michael under functioning, Sarah over functioning. She acknowledged the triangle is "probably there" as a reasonable hunch but questioned whether there was sufficient evidence for it. She also proposed a third possibility: coding only toward/away moves (Sarah toward mom, Michael away from mom) as the most conservative approach, avoiding premature conclusions about which mechanism is operating.

**Patrick:** Coded Sarah over functioning for Michael. His rationale: "I'm the only one holding it together and it's just exhausting, honestly — just on its face seemed like it was easy to draw a rule." He defined over/under functioning as: automatic behavior where someone is doing something for someone else without thinking, where there's an opportunity to choose differently — "wiggle room." He noted he did not pick up strong enough evidence for the triangle from this statement alone, though he acknowledged the assumption that Sarah is "probably on the inside" would be in line with what others would say.

### Deliberation

**Presentation order:** Patrick reviewed Kathy first, then Guillermo, then Laura, then his own coding. Guillermo's triangle coding was presented before Laura's over/under functioning, establishing the triangle framing as the first substantive code discussed.

**Key arguments:**

- Guillermo acknowledged his triangle coding was an attempt to "get as concrete as I could" but conceded he "can't really justify it right now" and would have preferred over/under functioning
- Laura stated both triangle and over/under functioning are "reasonable hunches" but raised the question of whether there is enough evidence for triangle
- Laura proposed the most conservative coding: toward/away moves only — "the most conservative core coding would be that Sarah moved towards her mom and Michael moves away from the mom. And it kind of does not come to conclusion about whether it's a triangle or over under functioning"
- Laura argued toward/away codes "have a lot of use because they don't come to premature conclusions about what's going on" and cited the possibility that Sarah's characterization of Michael could be a "misattribution"
- Kathy invoked seminar principles: "the goal to stick to the granular moves like toward, in a way and to not make assumptions about descriptors like under functioning, over functioning"
- Patrick defined over/under functioning: automatic behavior where there's opportunity to choose differently — the "wiggle room" concept (which he credited to Laura from a prior PBT meeting)
- Guillermo endorsed the wiggle room concept: "that's what you're trying to get people to do is to think about the degree to which something is useful, not useful, necessary, not necessary"
- Kathy asked whether you could code both triangle and over/under functioning for the same event — Guillermo responded that the challenge is "things play out in a triangle pattern... over under functioning, conflict, usually if those things are happening, they're happening in the context of a triangle"
- Patrick raised the end-state question: if you code both over/under functioning and triangle, "does that conflate things? Does that confuse things?" — bookmarked without resolution
- Patrick explained the delta correction mechanism: "the reason there's deltas is so you can update later. Even if it's four statements later" — meaning early coding errors matter less because the cumulative end state can be corrected through subsequent deltas (line 190)
- Laura asked "how would the rule be written?" for choosing between mechanisms — Patrick acknowledged this is exactly what the meetings need to produce but said rules "may evolve over time or we may need to come back to it." Laura suggested the AI "picks up from examples — oh, this one is like that example." Patrick confirmed this matches the system prompt architecture. (Lines 218-224)
- Patrick introduced vertical alignment: whatever rules emerge must work for IRR, AI training, and the apps simultaneously

**Evidence cited:**

- Statement text: "I feel like I'm the one holding everything together" — cited by multiple coders as evidence of over functioning
- Statement text: "Michael doesn't really help much" — cited as evidence of either under functioning, away move, or outside position
- Statement text: "It's just exhausting, honestly" — cited by Patrick as supporting an over functioning reading
- Seminar principle (Kathy): default to toward/away rather than assuming mechanisms
- Laura's hypothetical counter-evidence: Michael could be "out just busting his butt to borrow money from the family to help" — illustrating that the sister's framing may be unreliable
- Patrick's definition of over/under functioning as "automatic" behavior with "wiggle room" to choose differently

### Position Evolution

Guillermo shifted from triangle to over/under functioning during the discussion. He explicitly stated he "can't really justify" the triangle coding and said he would do over/under functioning if coding now.

Kathy shifted from anxiety-same (learning phase) to over/under functioning. She simultaneously argued for the more conservative toward/away approach based on seminar principles — her final position held some tension between these two.

Laura maintained her over/under functioning coding but expanded her position to propose toward/away as a viable alternative that avoids premature mechanism attribution.

Patrick maintained his over/under functioning coding throughout.

No resolution was reached on the three-way choice between triangle, over/under functioning, and toward/away. The group bookmarked this question.

### Resolution

**Final coding:** No formal consensus. Three coders (Guillermo, Laura, Patrick) converged toward over/under functioning as at least defensible. Kathy acknowledged she would code over/under functioning but also advocated for toward/away as more conservative. Laura's toward/away proposal was acknowledged but not formally adopted.

| | S | A | R | F |
|-|---|---|---|---|
| Sarah | — | — | Over functioning (tentative) | — |
| Michael | — | — | Under functioning (tentative) | — |

**Unanimity:** Unresolved — tentative convergence on over/under functioning, but toward/away remains a viable alternative; triangle largely abandoned
**Confidence:** Low

### Ambiguity Signal

Extended — this was the longest discussion of the meeting, spanning the core methodological question of mechanism attribution. The group cycled through triangle, over/under functioning, and toward/away without reaching closure.

### Rules Established

- Over/under functioning definition (proposed): automatic behavior where there is opportunity to choose differently — "wiggle room"
- Toward/away as conservative default (proposed, not adopted): when evidence supports multiple mechanisms, toward/away makes the fewest assumptions
- Vertical alignment constraint: coding rules must work across IRR, AI training, and apps
- Open question: can you code both triangle AND over/under functioning for the same event?

### Cross-Statement Connections

- The triangle vs. over/under vs. toward/away question recurs in Statements 3 and 4
- Guillermo revisits this in Statement 3 by proposing to "flip" — put over/under in Statement 2 and triangle in Statement 3
- Laura's weight loss study experience (discussed at length in Statement 4) provides the empirical grounding for her "end-state matters more than statement-level granularity" position

## Statement 3: "Michael is my younger brother...it feels like I'm the only one who's really involved with mom right now."

### Initial Positions

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Kathy | — | Up (Sarah) | — | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Over functioning (Sarah — same timestamp as Statement 2) | — |
| Laura | — | Up (Sarah) | Inside (triangle: Sarah/mom inside, Michael outside) | — |
| Patrick | — | — | Relationships only (added sibling link, parent pair bond) | — |

### Coder Reasoning

**Kathy:** Coded anxiety up for Sarah. Acknowledged this was still learning phase: "I don't have any explanation right here for my entries... I was just warming up." When asked how she would code it now, she said she would include over/under functioning and would add structural data: approximate birth date or wait for more info, add a parent pair bond for the shared parents, and identify Michael and Sarah as siblings.

**Guillermo:** Coded over functioning for Sarah at the same timestamp as his Statement 2 entry. In discussion, he recognized this as a duplicate (same timestamp, same person, same shift). He then proposed flipping his coding: over/under functioning in Statement 2 and triangle in Statement 3, because "here she really says explicitly, I'm the only one involved with mom right now" — but then immediately hedged: "it could just be a reiteration of the over functioning as well."

**Laura:** Initially coded anxiety up and inside (triangle move — Sarah and mom on inside, Michael on outside). But in the meeting, she revised her view: "actually looking at it today, I'm thinking, I don't know that I would code any shift. It's just kind of reiterating what was said in the first entry." Her date referenced the original six-months-ago event (mother's diagnosis), suggesting she viewed this as the same event rather than a new shift.

**Patrick:** Coded only structural data — relationships (sibling link, parent pair bond). Did not add any SARF shifts for this statement. However, during discussion he noted there is additional evidence for the triangle in the emotional sentiment of "I guess I just don't understand why he can't step up more" — he saw this as Sarah trying to get the coach on the inside with her against Michael.

### Deliberation

**Presentation order:** Kathy, Guillermo, Laura, Patrick.

**Key arguments:**

- Laura questioned whether this statement represents a new shift at all: "it's just kind of reiterating what was said in the first entry" — raising the question of when repeated evidence constitutes a new event vs. confirmation of an existing one
- Patrick countered that there is new evidence for the triangle here: "I guess I just don't understand why he can't step up more — that feels to me like she's trying to get the coach on the inside with her and her mother with Michael on the outside. A sentiment detector would probably pick that up"
- Laura acknowledged the triangle evidence but questioned the event mechanics: "the only problem I have with it is considering an event shift... It's not pointing to any different event. It's just pointing to the triangle that is probably the baseline here"
- Patrick responded by explaining the date certainty variable's three tiers: certain (±3.5 days), approximate (±6 months), and uncertain (no match at all — "it just ignores it"). You can add an event with an uncertain date to capture a baseline pattern without placing it at a specific point in time — "the date is just not matched at all in the statistics. But it does get it in the notes." He added: "it took me six years to finally decide to add" the date certainty variable because he "wasn't sure how to do it." (Lines 248, 257)
- Guillermo proposed flipping his codes: over/under functioning in Statement 2, triangle in Statement 3 — essentially distributing the two mechanisms across statements rather than choosing one. Laura and Guillermo converged on this: Laura said "I'm picking up more that there's a triangle" — framing the triangle as the contextual pattern within which over/under functioning operates, not as an alternative code. She articulated: "it's just adding the triangle pattern in which this over functioning and under functioning relationship exists." (Lines 268-273)
- Patrick proposed a structural rule: "the first time you're told that someone is a sibling, then that means there needs to be a common parent pair bond"
- Kathy raised the operational question about edit-existing-event vs. new-event, which led to a significant clarification (see Cross-Cutting Themes)
- Guillermo provided the key conceptual framing for the new-event rule: "from a macro level it looks like one shifting thing, but on a micro level, it would be these small atomic shifts over time which are independent but linked"

**Evidence cited:**

- Statement text: "Michael is my younger brother" — new factual information (sibling relationship, birth order)
- Statement text: "I guess I just don't understand why he can't step up more" — cited by Patrick as evidence of triangle (negative sentiment toward Michael, appeal to coach)
- Statement text: "it feels like I'm the only one who's really involved with mom right now" — cited by Guillermo as either over functioning evidence or reiteration
- Date certainty variable as mechanism for capturing baseline patterns without specific timestamps

### Position Evolution

Laura shifted from coding anxiety up + inside triangle to questioning whether any new shift should be coded at all. She acknowledged Patrick's point about additional triangle evidence in the emotional sentiment but did not reverse her revised position.

Guillermo shifted from viewing his Statement 2 and 3 entries as the same (duplicate) to proposing a distribution: over/under in Statement 2, triangle in Statement 3. This emerged from the group discussion rather than from new evidence.

Patrick stated he could not tell whether his inclination to add a triangle was "really me thinking independently... or if I'm just agreeing with the conversation honestly, because we're just — that happens so much" — an explicit acknowledgment of potential conformity pressure.

Kathy's major shift was operational: learning that she should create new events rather than using edit-existing-event to append to prior entries.

### Resolution

**Final coding:** No formal consensus. The group did not agree on whether this statement warrants a new shift or is a reiteration of Statement 2. Structural data (sibling relationship, parent pair bond) was agreed upon.

| | S | A | R | F |
|-|---|---|---|---|
| Structural | — | — | Sibling link established; common parent pair bond added | — |
| Shift (disputed) | — | Possibly up | Possibly inside (triangle) or over functioning; possibly no new shift | — |

**Unanimity:** Unresolved
**Confidence:** Low

### Ambiguity Signal

Moderate — less time spent than Statement 2, but the group did not converge. The new-shift-vs-reiteration question was left open.

### Rules Established

- First time someone is named as a sibling: add a common parent pair bond (even if parents are unnamed — use "Sarah's mother," "Sarah's father")
- Use new events for each shift; do not use "edit existing event" to append additional evidence to prior entries
- Deduplication: same timestamp + same person + same shift = remove duplicate (applied to Guillermo's entries)
- Date certainty variable three tiers: certain (±3.5 days), approximate (±6 months), uncertain (no match — ignored in statistics but preserved in notes). Can capture baseline patterns using uncertain dates. (Lines 248, 257)
- Kathy asked whether to put an approximate birth date for a younger sibling; Patrick said he "can't explicate" his reasoning but just left it, noting the date certainty granularity may not make it worthwhile

### Cross-Statement Connections

- Direct continuation of Statement 2's triangle vs. over/under vs. toward/away debate
- Guillermo's "flip" proposal (over/under in Statement 2, triangle in Statement 3) bridges both statements
- Laura's "reiteration" observation foreshadows her broader point in Statement 4 about end-state mattering more than statement-level granularity
- Kathy's edit-existing-event confusion affects her coding of Jennifer and Marcus (addressed in Process Observations)

## Statement 4: "Michael has always been a bit more laid back...he's really taken a step back...it frustrates me when I see him not trying."

### Initial Positions

| Coder | S | A | R | F |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Kathy | — | — | Distance (Michael from Sarah) + Over functioning (Sarah) | — |
| Guillermo | — | — | Over functioning (Sarah — duplicate from prior statement) | — |
| Laura | — | — | Distance (Michael from Sarah's mother) | — |
| Patrick | — | — | Away (Michael from Sarah + Sarah's mother) | — |

### Coder Reasoning

**Kathy:** Coded distance — Michael distancing from Sarah — plus over functioning for Sarah. Her rationale for distance: "He's always been a little bit more laid back. More so now. I was interpreting laid back as hanging back in the back, being more removed." She placed Michael as the person doing the distancing and Sarah as the recipient. She came to over functioning later than the others but arrived at it by this statement.

**Guillermo:** Coded over functioning for Sarah at the same timestamp as his prior entries — identified as a duplicate during discussion. No new substantive code for this statement.

**Laura:** Coded distance — Michael distancing from Sarah's mother. Her rationale: "I may be looking at it now would say the mother because it's a shift since her diagnosis." She chose the mother as the recipient rather than Sarah because the distancing behavior was temporally linked to the mother's diagnosis. She acknowledged: "who knows who he's distancing from — you could put both."

**Patrick:** Coded an away move — Michael moving away from both Sarah and Sarah's mother. His rationale: "away has a little less assumption" than distance. He explained that distance as a mechanism is meant to mean emotional distance — a specific claim about internal states and avoidance of anxiety-laden content. "Away" simply captures reduced involvement without assuming the emotional mechanism. He was "trying not to make an assumption about whether or not that was because it's too hard for him to coordinate with these people" and whether it truly is an emotional distance pattern.

### Deliberation

**Presentation order:** Kathy, Guillermo, Laura, Patrick.

**Key arguments:**

- Patrick articulated the away-vs-distance distinction: "away is always distance, but really distance as a mechanism is meant to mean emotional distance — it's, there's content to be discussed and we're not discussing it because of the anxiety of the tension." Away captures the observable behavior; distance implies the emotional mechanism driving it.
- Guillermo endorsed the minimal-assumption approach: "To minimize assumption, I think is a good rule."
- Guillermo cited Bowen: "emotional distance is part of every mechanism" — arguing that distance is so pervasive it may not be informative as a specific code. Laura asked to see the reference and noted it was a new thought for her but acknowledged that Bowen made emotional distance a separate mechanism.
- Laura responded that "away" can mean something that is "not necessarily an emotional reaction" — a useful distinction.
- Patrick supported this with the observation that the transcript already contains Sarah's own uncertainty about Michael's motives: "she doesn't really understand why he's not engaging and she's aware that she may be misattributing that."
- Kathy's distance coding raised the question of who Michael is distancing from — Sarah or mother. Laura chose mother; Kathy chose Sarah. Patrick coded both as recipients.
- Patrick noted a data model point: the coder supports multiple recipients on a single relationship shift
- Patrick cited Dan Papero: "people are pretty good at reporting whether or not they think that they're staying away from a person or if there's tension" — relevant to the reliability of Sarah's characterization of Michael. He added personal evidence: "I look at myself and Connie and it's like we both know when there's tension. Holy crap. Every time." (Lines 378-380)
- Laura countered the self-report reliability point: "You know, there's a lot of denial going around." Patrick acknowledged: "That's true. Yeah. It's a good point." This complicates the assumption that people reliably self-report distance and tension, introducing denial as a confounding factor. (Lines 381-382)
- Laura then made an extended argument drawing on the weight loss IRR study she conducted with Kathy: "the thing that mattered in the end was was there a shift, whatever the heck it was, that affected anxiety and functioning." She argued that because "the emotional system has, is expressing multiple patterns at any given moment," coders can reasonably code specific items differently but still agree at the level that matters — whether there was a shift and its impact on anxiety/functioning.
- Kathy corroborated this from the weight loss study: they evolved their method over time, their specific coding was less important than identifying relevant shifts and their association with outcome changes
- Patrick acknowledged Laura's point as significant but noted the vertical alignment constraint: AI training requires explicit rules at the statement level even if the human evaluation pass is holistic. He framed this as a tension: "statement by statement level, more variation — which is part of your main point. We may be coding this differently... Part of the goal is figuring out what, how much of it matters."

**Evidence cited:**

- Statement text: "Michael has always been a bit more laid back" — Sarah's characterization, which could be misattributed
- Statement text: "he's really taken a step back" — evidence of away/distance move
- Statement text: "it frustrates me when I see him not trying" — emotional sentiment, possible triangle evidence
- Statement text: "I don't want to blame him completely. Maybe he just doesn't know how to handle it" — Sarah's own uncertainty about Michael's motives, cited by Patrick as supporting away over distance
- Bowen reference (Guillermo): "emotional distance is part of every mechanism"
- Dan Papero reference (Patrick): people are good at self-reporting distance and tension
- Weight loss IRR study (Laura, Kathy): end-state agreement on shift + impact mattered more than statement-level mechanism labels
- Semantic similarity principle: Laura's description "Michael doesn't help" was present tense, matching her present-date timestamp — Patrick noted this as an important correspondence between event description tense and timestamp

### Position Evolution

No major position shifts occurred during this statement's discussion. The discussion was more meta-methodological than position-changing.

Laura expanded from her specific coding (distance, Michael from mother) into a broader methodological argument about granularity, but did not change her original code.

Patrick explicitly chose not to change his original data: "I'm going to leave this here because it's important that we keep the original disagreements there."

### Resolution

**Final coding:** No consensus on the specific mechanism code. Agreement that Michael is moving away/distancing (observable behavior), but disagreement on: (a) the recipient — Sarah, mother, or both; (b) the mechanism label — away, distance, or over/under; (c) whether statement-level precision on mechanism matters.

| | S | A | R | F |
|-|---|---|---|---|
| Michael | — | — | Away or distance (from Sarah and/or mother) — mechanism label unresolved | — |

**Unanimity:** Unresolved on specifics; implicit agreement on the observable behavioral direction
**Confidence:** Moderate (agreement on behavioral direction, low on mechanism label)

### Ambiguity Signal

Extended — substantial discussion spanning the specific coding, the away-vs-distance distinction, recipient identification, and a meta-methodological debate about whether statement-level mechanism precision matters.

### Rules Established

- Minimize assumptions: prefer away over distance when evidence is ambiguous about whether emotional distance (as a specific mechanism) is operating
- Semantic similarity between event description tense and timestamp (e.g., present-tense description should match present-date timestamp)
- The data model supports multiple recipients on a single relationship shift
- Don't change reviewed case data retroactively — preserve original disagreements for methodological integrity

### Cross-Statement Connections

- Direct continuation of the mechanism-attribution debate from Statements 2 and 3
- Laura's weight loss study reference provides empirical precedent for the "end-state matters more" argument that ran through all four statements
- Patrick's away-vs-distance distinction builds on the minimize-assumptions principle that emerged in Statement 2 (toward/away as conservative default)
- The question of who Michael is distancing from connects to Statement 2's triangle discussion — if he's distancing from both Sarah and mother, that's consistent with an outside triangle position

## Process Observations

### Scheduling
- Next meeting: February 23 (one week later, not the standard two-week cadence)
- Attendees for Feb 23: Patrick, Kathy, Guillermo only — Laura traveling and unavailable
- Laura committed to not scheduling conflicts with future meeting dates
- Standard cadence is every two weeks on Mondays; compressed to one week due to upcoming travel conflicts (Laura's Florida presentation, Kathy's potential flight on March 2)

### Operational Corrections
- Kathy's edit-existing-event usage: Kathy had been extensively using "edit existing event" in her Jennifer and Marcus codings. The group clarified this is incorrect — each shift should be a new event. Patrick granted permission for Kathy to go back and fix Jennifer and Marcus codings since those have not been reviewed yet. Rule: do not change Sarah coding (preserve historical record for methodology); can change unreviewed cases.

### Meeting Process
- Patrick acknowledged the meeting format was experimental: "I don't really know how to run this discussion session"
- Tab-switching between coder views was cumbersome; Patrick noted the IRR dashboard needs work for side-by-side comparison
- Patrick initially opened his development version instead of production, causing brief confusion about whose coding was displayed
- Laura joined approximately 15 minutes late (Kathy noted this matches Laura's pattern from Sebastopol seminar days — "do you remember every seminar in Sebastopol when she would get there about 10 or 15 minutes late?" Patrick: "data points, you know, n of 10")
- All attendees confirmed no hard stop at one hour (Presidents' Day holiday for Patrick and Guillermo; Laura retired; Guillermo: "no clinic for me")
- Meeting ran approximately 1 hour 40 minutes before wrap-up began

### Closing Meta-Discussion on Process Improvement
- Laura suggested the group "set up regular meetings, have them be an hour, hour and a half... and see if we improve." She proposed a phased approach: "for the first few meetings to stop and take more time to discuss and then maybe we should have a meeting where there's, you know, we just don't discuss, just go through and look at our different ways we're scoring it and see if we're getting any closer." (Line 412)
- Patrick emphasized the value of conversation itself: "regardless of even how far we go, meeting by meeting, the conversation forces us. It just makes us really think about what these codes are and gets us really doing the important thinking on a level that you can't do on your own." (Line 409)
- Guillermo suggested that Patrick's vertical alignment perspective "could be what frames our meetings over time, like what you're seeing" — proposing that Patrick's cross-cutting view of how coding rules interact with apps and AI could guide the discussion agenda. (Line 421)
- Patrick responded: "I definitely watch that like a hawk because if we do something in here that doesn't work with one of the apps, I'm screwed." He cited a concrete example: "Laura was having me fix some bugs in a diagram the other day... and that actually overlapped with the problem there, overlapped with things that are impacted by changes in this training model." This illustrates the practical reality of the vertical alignment constraint. (Line 422)
- Patrick framed the humorous aside "Kathy wants to triangle with you" to Laura after the main meeting when Kathy wanted to stay behind to ask questions — an in-vivo application of Bowen theory concepts to the group's own process. (Line 490)

### Data Pipeline
- Patrick described the transcript-to-AI-processing-to-rule-extraction pipeline: Zoom transcripts will be checked into the source code repository, then processed by AI agents to produce structured meeting summaries that capture coding arguments and emerging rules at a level of detail better than manual note-taking
- Laura mentioned she has "just tons of notes from Kathy and I" from the weight loss study that she was "trying to track on pen and paper." Patrick suggested scanning and digitizing them for AI analysis: "Claude, Cowork... you could probably do that" — referencing Anthropic's Claude desktop application as a tool for processing handwritten research notes. (Lines 431-445)

### Patrick's AI Personal Experience
- While introducing Statement 4, Patrick went on a tangent about his personal use of the AI app: "The AI conversation is in so much better now. It's actually impressive and it helped me in like 10 statements see a correlation in my own timeline I'd never thought of before. And it asked me a question that actually made my brain hurt about my parental triangle." He described this as evidence that the AI product can surface insights humans miss in their own data. (Line 319)

### Laura's HIPAA/Confidentiality Discussion
- After the main meeting, Laura raised concerns about case identifiability for her upcoming Florida presentation. She cited HIPAA research: "when I put this through AI it said if you're doing something and you're doing an account over time, the story becomes identifiable." The standard she cited: "the person, if they run into it, will they recognize" themselves. She proposed changing the subject's sex to make the case unidentifiable: "I was thinking of turning this person into a gay person, a different, just change their sex." Patrick endorsed this as standard practice for public presentations: "for public presentations I think it's a good standard to set to just make it unidentifiable at all those levels." (Lines 481-489)

### Time Limit Proposal
- Patrick mentioned he had included in the primer document a suggestion to set time limits per statement or per topic to keep meetings moving. He raised this during the Statement 2 discussion: "one of the things that came up... is to also kind of set a time limit on per statement or per topic to keep it moving." This was not enforced in this meeting but flagged for future use. (Line 202)

### Patrick's Statement 2 Coding Correction
- Patrick discovered he was viewing his development version instead of production, causing confusion about whose coding was displayed (Kathy's anxiety-same was showing under his tab). After switching to the production version, he found his Statement 2 coding and recalled: "I might have changed this and broken it when I was teaching the course at the Michigan School." He corrected it back to over functioning, framing this as fixing a mistake rather than changing his opinion. He explicitly distinguished this from Statement 3: "I'm going to leave this here because it's important that we keep the original disagreements there." (Lines 204-210, 280)

### Person Delta Mechanics
- Patrick clarified the coder's person-delta system: people only need to be added once via a delta, after which they accumulate in the diagram's "right column" and don't need to be repeated for each statement. Kathy asked about this: "you don't include people who are even prior people in that under People, just anybody involved in that particular transcription right there." Patrick confirmed and explained the principle. (Lines 168-170)

### Participant Self-Assessment
- All four coders acknowledged improvement from Sarah to subsequent cases
- Kathy characterized her Sarah coding as "the crudest and the most unskilled"
- Guillermo confirmed "I started getting better after Sarah"
- Laura noted she finished Sarah coding the night before the meeting, returning to it "a half a dozen times over a month"
- Patrick expected Sarah to be a throwaway case, with the question being whether Marcus and Jennifer will also be throwaways
