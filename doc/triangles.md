Based on the theoretical literature provided, here are specific names and vignettes that illustrate the concepts discussed:

### Vignette 1: The Johnson Family
**Characters:** 
- **Mary Johnson:** A devoted mother who has always taken care of her son, David, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
- **David Johnson:** The 28-year-old son, often referred to as "the patient" by the family and medical staff.
- **Tom Johnson:** The father, who tends to avoid conflict and often supports Mary’s perspective.

**Scenario:** 
In the Johnson household, Mary has always been the one to manage David's care, often referring to him as "my sick boy." When David was first diagnosed, Mary became emotionally enmeshed in his illness, believing that her role was to protect him from the world. During family therapy, the therapist encouraged Mary to stop labeling David as "sick" and to view him as an adult capable of making his own choices. Initially resistant, Mary struggled to change her perception, stating, "What else can I call him? He is sick!" Over time, she began to see David as more than just his diagnosis, which allowed for a healthier dynamic in their relationship. David, in turn, started to assert his independence, leading to a more balanced family interaction.

### Vignette 2: The Smith Family
**Characters:**
- **Linda Smith:** A 35-year-old wife who feels overwhelmed by her husband’s emotional issues.
- **Mark Smith:** Linda’s husband, who often plays the role of the "neurotic" in the family.
- **Therapist:** Dr. Bowen, who facilitates their family therapy sessions.

**Scenario:**
Linda sought therapy alone after Mark refused to attend. In sessions, she often described Mark as "neurotic" and expressed frustration over his inability to cope with stress. Dr. Bowen challenged her to stop viewing Mark through this lens. He suggested she "play like" Mark was not neurotic, which Linda found difficult. After several sessions, she reported, "I’ve stopped calling him neurotic, but I still think of him that way." This realization prompted a breakthrough; Linda began to focus on her own emotional responses rather than Mark's behavior. Eventually, Mark joined the therapy, and they worked together to redefine their roles, moving from a parent-child dynamic to a partnership.

### Vignette 3: The Garcia Family
**Characters:**
- **Carlos Garcia:** A 40-year-old father who struggles with his own emotional issues.
- **Sofia Garcia:** Carlos’s wife, who often feels the need to take care of him.
- **Therapist:** Dr. Minuchin, who emphasizes the importance of family dynamics.

**Scenario:**
Carlos often presented himself as helpless, seeking validation from Sofia. During therapy, Dr. Minuchin pointed out the pattern of triangulation, where Sofia would become anxious and focus on Carlos’s needs, neglecting her own. The therapist encouraged Sofia to establish boundaries and communicate her own feelings. Initially, Carlos reacted with anger, accusing Sofia of not loving him. However, as Sofia began to assert herself, Carlos was forced to confront his own dependency. This shift allowed both to grow individually and as a couple, leading to a healthier family dynamic.

### Vignette 4: The Lee Family
**Characters:**
- **Anna Lee:** A 50-year-old mother who has been labeled as "overbearing."
- **Kevin Lee:** Anna’s 22-year-old son, who has been diagnosed with anxiety.
- **Therapist:** Dr. Ackerman, who uses video sessions to illustrate family interactions.

**Scenario:**
In therapy, Anna often dominated the conversation, expressing her worries about Kevin’s future. Dr. Ackerman used video recordings of their sessions to show Anna how her behavior affected Kevin. She realized that her attempts to control the situation were rooted in her own anxiety. After viewing the footage, Anna stated, "I didn’t see how much I was pushing him." This awareness led to a significant change; Anna began to listen more and support Kevin’s independence, allowing him to take charge of his own life decisions.

These vignettes illustrate the complexities of family dynamics and the challenges of shifting from an individual-oriented perspective to a family-unit approach in therapy. Each family member's journey reflects the theoretical concepts discussed in the literature, emphasizing the importance of emotional awareness and the impact of labels on family relationships.
